        "“PEMS are the next level of emission monitoring in a cost effective and regulatory compliant manner. Compared to the traditional CEMS, PEMS do not use hardware-based sensors to measure emissions, but instead use unique algorithms to determine the emissions signature of an engine, based on the input parameters. ",
        "The digital models include Siemens Energy’s unique OEM experience, allowing operators to significantly reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of emissions measurement activities. PEMS can be operated as redundant systems next to CEMS or as standalone certified systems without CEMS.\"",

        "PEMS are the next level of emission monitoring in a cost effective and regulatory compliant manner. The digital models include Siemens Energy’s unique OEM experience, allowing operators to significantly reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of emissions measurement activities.  Watch the webinar recording to learn more about PEMS to reduce maintenance costs.",
        "The PEMS product is a digital solution, taking engine operational data and feeding through a unique set of algorithms, determining the emissions signature of the engine.",
        "Emissions calculations without additional instrumentation requirement at site.",
        "Significant reduction in operational and maintenance costs compared to a traditional hardware-based based emissions monitoring system. The lower CAPEX and OPEX, estimated 50-80% compared to CEMS lifecycle cost.",
        "Ultimate confidence in the PEMS model using thermodynamic knowledge of the engine, as well as verification of several years of reliable factory test data on every unit shipped, as well as access our fleet and field operating experience and data.",
        "PEMS do not require trained and skilled operators.",
        "It is possible for our PEMS solution to run in highly contaminated flue gases and harsh environmental conditions, since the solution is completely digitalized in nature, therefore negating the requirement for costly SIL/ATEX rated hardware.",
        "PEMS can be used by the customer as well as Siemens Energy in potentially identifying engine performance issues using the associated PEMS data for fault finding and analysis.",
        "Customers around the globe relay on Continuous Emission Monitoring System and Predictive Emissions Monitoring System from Siemens Energy.",
        "We appreciate your interest in our product. If you have questions or need more information, feel free to contact us!",
