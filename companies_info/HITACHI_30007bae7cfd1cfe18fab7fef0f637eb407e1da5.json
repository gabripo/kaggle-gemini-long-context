        "Hitachi Energy Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) and Pressure Relief Devices (PRD) are designed to quickly discharge the pressure at pre-set thresholds. Our PRV or PRD will discharge rapidly increasing internal pressures that could be caused by a sudden and violent short circuit inside a transformer. These safety accessories reduce the risk of possible injury to nearby personnel, equipment, and environmental damages that a catastrophic transformer failure would cause.",
