        "As energy transition progresses step-by-step, the global demand for sustainable industrial manufacturing has never been higher. Companies need to demonstrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or verify the volume of CO2 emissions in their products. In addition, there is a growing demand to prove the sustainability of green products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthetic fuels, green steel, and other commodities.",
        "With CertaLink Energy Certification, we can track the environmental impact of sustainable production processes along the entire product cycle.",
        "CertaLink Energy Certification is already proving the green origin of the e-fuels applications in the Porsche motorsport fleet at Haru Oni. Step by step, Haru Oni is transforming the fuel industry, supported by the certification process to validate the green origins of e-fuels. ",
        "Developed with innovation partners TÜV SÜD and the German Energy Agency (dena), CertaLink Energy Certification uses blockchain technology to connect physical assets to digital decentralized infrastructure. It tracks the low and zero carbon energy from source to consumption along the value chain, validating the energy's origin plus providing detailed insights and attributes. As a result of automated and tamper-proof recording and tracking of energy-specific data, a CertaLink certificate is valid around the world through the entire low or zero carbon value chain.  ",
        "Are you already a registered customer? If yes, you can access your personal dashboard here.",
        "If you need assistance, please find your service contact here.",
        "If you are not registered yet, please get in touch.",
        "Sustainability certificates such as CertaLink Energy Certificates enable \"Sustainability Claims\" in an automated, tamper-proof, and government-approved manner. Sustainably certified products have a higher market value and offer benefits like customs and tax relief for imports and exports These green energy certifications are required by all companies that wish to market their products as sustainable. With a CertaLink certificate, you can trace the zero or low carbon origin of your products throughout the entire value chain.",
        "Whether you are planning your facility, or you have already established a production facility, you can connect to the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. We will connect the certification manager with your Instrumentation and Control system or smart meters to access your measurement data and generate green energy certificates for your products. Plant shutdowns are usually not necessary.",
        "The CertaLink certification process is comparable to classic ISO certifications, but the products are continuously certified per production unit. To receive the corresponding automated issued certificate, companies must adhere to a conventional certification approach. ",
        "We will advise you to choose the optimal certification scheme for your business purposes and prepare the certification together with you. There are document checklists depending on the selected certification scheme. A detailed list of required documents will be provided to you so that you can prepare your sustainability certification in a structured manner.  ",
        "In order to apply an internationally accepted renewable energy certification standard, we are partnering with independent certification bodies, e.g. TÜV SÜD and dena, the German Energy Agency.",
        "It is important to distinguish between three types of fees. An onboarding fee is charged during the connection and commissioning of the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. A yearly membership fee is charged after completed onboarding. Later on, each certificate creation will incur a fee.",
        "The CertaLink Energy Certification Manager is based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Unlike public chains, where transactions are publicly available to everyone, in CertaLink the data is processed on a private permissioned blockchain. It means that only independent trusted and explicitly contracted node operators are participating in the network with limited access to structured data. All site data is transferred in encoded format and converted into declarations by DLT smart contracts. These declarations can be shared based on commercial operator settings.",
        "“TÜV SÜD has a clear focus on sustainability and decarbonization. We are excited to join forces with Siemens Energy and dena to innovate together on the Clean Energy Certification platform. This new service ensures trust and enables the trace of origin across the Power-to-X value chains.”",
        "Reiner Block CEO Division Industry Service TÜV SÜD AG",
        "“The CertaLink Energy Certification Manager is the solution to a complex problem. It enables economic participants to concentrate on their main business and to automatically process a significant part of the verification process via the CertaLink Manager. The CertaLink Manager thus represents a new step in the digitalization of the energy transition.”",
        "Kristina Haverkamp Managing Director German Energy Agency (dena)",
        "For assistence get in touch with our first level support by our partner dena, the Deutsche Energie-Agentur – the German Energy Agency.",
        "Whether it's renewable energy, e-fuels, sustainable steel, or another product, we can help you certify it. Get in touch with us to arrange a consultation for your specific needs and discover how we can assist you. ",
