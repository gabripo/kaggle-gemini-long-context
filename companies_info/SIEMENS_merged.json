By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens.",
            "With the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system.",
            "Your advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC",
            "The synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent.",
            "The SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control, and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC.",

Our PEM fuel cells deliver an atmospheric air-independent, noiseless propulsion solution for power generation on board that can extend the dive time by several weeks.",
            "The PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be extended to weeks, if required, which significantly minimizes the risk of being detected. That’s because the PEM fuel cell modules use oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity, so the potential dive time is restricted only by the supply of stored media and the boat’s energy demand. The system works without atmospheric air and is completely exhaust-free.",
            "Another important advantage is that the PEM fuel cell has an ultimately low signature in operation: This helps reducing the aggregate acoustic signature of the submarine. The system’s noise signature lies well under all threshold values. With their electrochemical properties, the fuel cells themselves operate noiselessly. Even the ancillary units are optimized for low noise or can be easily incorporated into noise encapsulation thanks to their compact design.",
            "Your advantages with PEM fuel cells",
            "The operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system. Our SG-DC supply and switching system delivers a reliable power supply to the propulsion system and the various onboard networks.",
            "To secure the optimum power supply for your boat in any situation, SG-DC ensures the supply, distribution, and monitoring of electrical energy for the propulsion system and all onboard networks. It is the ideal equipment for meeting the specific requirements of submarines with respect to shock and vibration resistance, electromagnetic shielding and acoustics, and external influences such as temperature, air humidity, and air pressure.",
            "SG-DC incorporates the main control panel for connecting the energy producers to the propulsion system, and also the auxiliary power distribution for the individual consumers and all onboard networks. The system is tailored to the individual requirements of every boat and its key characteristics are superb reliability, compact build, and low maintenance.",

            "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker.",
            "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. ",

The silicone rubber housing is directly molded onto the metal oxide varistors (MOVs) and the surrounding cage made of FRP rods. This creates a reliable seal that prevents moisture ingress and partial discharges.",

The arc can escape directly through the soft silicone housing without damaging the mechanical structure. No internal parts are ejected in the process. The innovative Siemens Energy cage design is very secure.",

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation.

As a first step, this can be achieved by making fuel usage more efficient. Later, this fossil fuel can be replaced with carbon-free fuel. Alternatively, heat production can also be electrified by using power from renewable energy. Existing heat networks can be transformed fast and at a large scale into cost-effective and flexible low-carbon energy systems.",
            "There are several applications that can help you to decarbonize heat networks. At Siemens Energy, we provide tailor-made CHP and Power to Heat (P2H) solutions for residential, commercial, or industrial sectors.",
            "CHP generates electricity and heat from a single fuel source. Traditional heating plants emit varying amounts of CO2 depending on the fuel used. Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%. Additionally, converting the plant into a GT-powered CHP or a Combined Cycle Power Plant with heat extraction can significantly improve its electrical efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency can be as high as 90% while using as little fuel as possible.",
            "Find out which gas turbine fits best for your application.",
            "Power-to-heat (P2H) can be accomplished through heat pumps or electric boilers. Heat pumps utilize waste or environmental heat, raising its temperature with electricity. They produce the same heat using less electricity than electric boilers, leading to lower operational costs. Electric boilers require minimal capital investment and have quick installation.

To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H).",

Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time.

            "This can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius.",
            "Traditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits. ",

They are available as series reactors, variable and fixed shunt reactors with a rated power from ≤10 MVAr to 300 MVAr (33 kV to 800 kV). ",
            "Reactors from Siemens Energy come with benefits at various levels to help grid operators achieve and maintain a reliable and secure power supply system. For over 100 years, we have closely cooperated with energy providers and grid operators. Drawing on these decades of experience, we have tailored our processes − from consulting to design, from manufacturing to testing and after-sales services − to meet the needs of our customers and their individually customized units. Siemens Energy manufactures the full range of reactors for all customer needs in a variety of application areas. With the increase of renewable and distributed power generation reactors – and variable shunt reactors in particular – play a significant role in today’s energy landscape with its higher fluctuation in power feed-in. Reactors of Siemens Energy are compact and robust with stable performance over the complete service life. Customers can optionally choose features like low-noise/low-loss version, extended 80%-regulation range and green design options.",
            "While fixed shunt reactors are designed for defined system condition and are cost-effective, variable shunt reactors (VSR) offer flexibility and efficiency in grids dealing with fluctuating power flows. VSRs adjust reactor power rating to actual needs, leading to lower losses and noise emissions, making them the ideal choice for networks experiencing continuous fluctuations.",
            "The decision to opt for a fixed SHR often has technical reasons, but the - admittedly more substantial - investment in a variable shunt reactor does pay off: With increasing load fixed shunt reactors will overcompensate the voltage increase, resulting in an overall voltage drops, while variable shunt reactors always compensate accurately and adjust to the current load situation.",
            "With Siemens Energy, you are not just investing in a product but a partnership. We offer in-house grid consulting to help you find the most cost-efficient solution for your grid. Our reactors are manufactured under the highest quality standards and are designed to be compact, resulting in lower costs for substation construction and increased grid capacity.",

            "How to increase transmission system capacity and stability: The ongoing transformation of the energy system requires effective means to cope with growing challenges when it comes to reliable power transmission. Instead of building new lines to provide sufficient transmission capacity, it’s often better to use our flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) technology to increase the transmission capacity. Both newly built transmission lines and existing systems benefit from Siemens Energy’ FSC which is part of the series compensation (SC) solutions that also help to improve the quality and stability of power transmission lines.",
            "Innovative series compensation technology provides higher transmission capacities for existing long-distance AC transmission lines and increased grid stability without the costs and time-requirement of building new lines.",
            "For decades, fixed series capacitor (FSC) technology from Siemens Energy has improved grid stability and contributed to the optimal utilization of transmission lines. Transmission system operators around the world have already benefited from solutions that were tailored to their specific requirements. Among the main benefits of FSC are the reduction of line voltage drops, limitation of load-dependent drops, and a reduction of the transmission angle.",
            "Increased maximum capacity",
            "Fixed series capacitor expands the transmission capacity of lines by compensating the impedance of the overhead line. It’s a cost-efficient way to achieve larger transmission capacities instead of building new lines.",
            "Increased grid stability",
            "With fixed series compensation, it’s possible to provide system stability for bulk power transmission and long transmission lines by reducing voltage drops at the point of connection. This increases overall grid stability.",
            "Economical solution",
            "The fixed series capacitors are the most cost-efficient solution. Their simple, proven and robust technology supports transmission system operators by optimizing power transmission and increasing transmission capacity. Siemens Energy is proud to reiterate: All major components are sourced in-house.",
            "The amount of power that can be transferred with long overhead transmission lines is limited by the impedance that can lead to voltage drops. For decades, fixed series compensation is the proven solution to maintain a minimum voltage profile and maximize utilization of transmission lines. ",
            "It works by connecting a capacitor bank in series with the transmission line to partially compensate the inductive impedance of the line while also increasing the voltage at the point of connection. The capacitors are protected by metal-oxide varistors (MOV) and – in case of a fault – by tripping the FSC and closing the bypass breaker. For instant protection, a triggered spark gap bypasses capacitors and MOVs within less than 1 ms. Even gap-less solutions are possible, provided that local requirements match. Due to this complexity Siemens Energy recommends and offers individually designed solutions with fixed series capacitors."

            "Concentrated solar thermal power is worldwide becoming a more and more important source for power generation. The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field.",
            "Dubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world.",
            "Since the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats.",
            "The basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency.",
            "With our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling.",
            "Parabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam.",
            "The parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants.",
            "A circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine.",
            "The advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field. This means that higher working fluid temperatures in the receiver (up to 1000°C) and better steam parameters are feasible, even supercritical steam is expected.",
            "The number of concentrated solar power plants has increased tremendously in the past ten years. Today we see many different regimes of operations, each of which poses a different challenge to power generation equipment. The design of each steam turbine is adapted to these challenges.",

With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating. By removing waste heat, the heat pump also provides cooling for the electrolyzer, minimizing the need for other cooling equipment.

            "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. ",
            "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.",

            "The 8VN1 Blue GIS maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2.",
            "Also in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV. ",

In order to foster decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector, the IMO fixed a target of 80% cut of GHG emissions until 2050 and cut of 100% until 2100. The path towards decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector will also lead to the reduction and/or abatement of pollutants like CO, NOX, SOX, PM, BC, HC that are emitted by fossil fuels combustion. The installation of a methanol reformer coupled to a HTPEM fuel cell could represent an interesting solution as auxiliary power unit of yachts and superyachts, to cover the hotel load but also to sustain slow speed cruising and maneuvering operations in ports.",

Along with air pollution mitigation, on board noise will be abated while underwater noise will be reduced thanks to the elimination of diesel generators. The solution adopted constitutes a zero-carbon technology for the maritime sector, adopting green methanol whose large capacity production is growing at both EU and extra-EU level.",

            "Concentrated solar thermal power is worldwide becoming a more and more important source for power generation. The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field.",
            "Dubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world.",
            "Since the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats.",
            "The basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency.",
            "With our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling.",
            "Parabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam.",
            "The parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants.",
            "A circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine.",
            "The advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker.",

        "content": [
            "While it is obvious that a refurbishment of high-voltage components is needed at some point, the right time as well as scope needs to be defined. There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably.",
            "Basically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment.",
            "HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime.",
            "Thanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably.",
            "Grid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects.",
            "Refurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system. ",
            "Three basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies.",
            "High-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio:",
            "Reasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components.",
            "Siemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan. ",
            "No refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project.",
            "Siemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support.",
            "Finding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system.",
            "While regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance. ",
            "Siemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects.",
            "The Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security. In a nutshell: Partnering with Siemens Energy makes sure that your refurbishment project will be a complete success.       "

For example, repowering steam power plants with new gas turbines. It also lays the foundation for a mid-term solution: turning existing brownfield power plants into decarbonized hybrid power plants, which could include power generation from renewable energy sources, various storage technologies, and grid stability services. All of this lays the groundwork for future net zero energy systems. Such systems could facilitate sector coupling by integrating renewables, industry, or mobility sectors with the help of green hydrogen. ",

If technology preselection, e.g., fuel switch, energy storage, heat pumps, etc. is an important factor for you, we can develop your project directly. Whatever your approach, in the end your solution will be a combination of technology components tailored to your business case, market demands as well as efficiency and decarbonization goals.",

            "Make an investment in your independence – and ensure a reliable and flexible power supply for your processes. Electricity and heating are major cost factors for industrial plants. That means there’s a long-term cost benefit in having your own power plant at your factory, mining, or production facility. It also helps you achieve climate goals and stay ahead of the competition. We will create just the right power plant solution for your purposes.",
            "Global megatrends and the energy transformation redefine the requirements for competitiveness in all energy-intensive industries. Reliable, economical and environmentally compatible supplies of power, steam, heating and cooling play an increasingly important role. Get ready for the future with us: Concentrate on your core business, while we help you manage your energy supply.",
            "Every industry, every factory, and every facility has its own unique demands for power supply. That’s why we configure and optimize your system individually, from the initial design to the final component. It goes without saying that we incorporate technologies proven in hundreds of facilities and over thousands of operating hours. Another factor that cuts your project risk: We pre-manufacture entire modules and test them away from the construction site. This means much less expense incurred on-site at your facility.",
            "Siemens Energy has a thorough understanding of the processes in your industry. After all, we’ve been building, expanding, and modernizing all kinds of industrial facilities for decades. We know that production processes have to be closely interlinked with ancillary activities like electricity and heat generation and energy distribution. Only once everything is integrated can the opportunities for automation and digitalization be exploited to the full.",
            "Processing mineral raw materials requires a vast amount of energy. That’s why procuring electricity and heat makes up a significant proportion of operating costs. Entities that supply their own electricity and heat using their own power plant will enjoy significant cost savings. And with a sturdy, state-of-the-art combined cycle power plant, they can also substantially improve their environmental life cycle assessment.",
            "From production to transportation and refining – the oil and gas business is getting tougher. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations are forcing many players to take action. Companies that invest in state-of-the-art on-site power generation enjoy multiple benefits – by curbing their emissions through the flexible use of available raw materials and also by using technologies that seamlessly integrate into their production systems. We provide you robust mechanical engineering that will operate reliably – even with frequent changes of load and fluctuating gas quality.",
            "Whether you process recycled fiber or use cellulose and lignin from the raw material wood, your systems will consume large volumes of electricity and heat. Generate your own process steam with an integrated power plant on-site. We offer plants with combined heat and power (CHP) in all scales to meet every need. That means you can remain flexible and independent over the long run.",
            "Mining is all about raw materials. When it comes to competition, it is production costs that matter – and energy costs are a key factor. The remote regions where raw materials are extracted are often not connected to public power networks. An on-site supply requires flexible facilities that can deliver power under tough conditions at low cost. Whether it’s for open-cast or underground mining, in cold or hot environments, as a standalone system or a back-up for renewable sources – we will design and build exactly the power plant solution you need to bolster your competitive position.",
            "Safety is paramount in chemical processes, and outages are both risky and costly – so your electricity supply must be totally reliable. This works best if you have your own generating system on-site, which will make you independent of external suppliers and curb costs in the long term. If a power plant also permits heat extraction, all the better – that will make your entire system even more efficient. We build the right solution for you – and integrate it seamlessly into your chain of processes.",
            "The energy landscape is changing. Small gas-fired power plants will be a mainstay of our energy supply system for the foreseeable future. That’s because they can serve as a flexible back-up for renewables, they’re highly efficient and operate reliably, and they can enable regions to function independently. On islands or at remote industrial sites, covering basic load or peak, with or without heat extraction – our industrial power plant solution will perfectly suit your specific requirements.",
            "The SGT-800 is the flagship of the Siemens portfolio of industrial gas turbines and provides excellent performance in combined cycle operation. It has proven itself in grid support and as a reliable backup for renewable energy sources. It is equally well-suited for independently supplying an industrial facility, with or without a grid connection. You can build on a fleet availability of over 97 percent.",
            "Get even more out of the energy in your fuel: A steam generator will use waste heat from the gas turbine to generate steam, which can drive a steam turbine. Combined cycle operation pays off.",
            "New gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability. ",
            "More than 1,500 power stations are in use around the world. Here are some of our top projects we have implemented with our customers.",
            "Do you want to supply your facility with power, reliably and cost-effectively? Or free yourself from reliance on a costly public supply? Do you need a flexible reserve power plant? Together we’ll find the perfect solution for your particular challenge.",

It controls the turbine over the full power range and allows output speed to be controlled. Starting may be either from a 24-volt D.C. electric motor or by a gas starter motor driving through a Bendix drive on to the turbine axial compressor shaft. When operating on gaseous fuels the pilot igniter can be supplied with gas from the main fuel system via a pressure reducing valve. For engines burning liquid fuel the igniter gas supply is taken from a gas bottle or similar source of supply. The control equipment is housed in two cabinets mounted in the turbine under base, the hydraulic control cabinet housing the engine instruments, pressure switches a servo system component while the electrical control cabinet contains the associated relays, timers, wiring and terminals, the selection switches, the annunciator panel, and the T Max temperature indicator. ",

The main engine pump is driven through the auxiliary gear train from the output shaft. Oil cooling is by either an air blast or water-cooled cooler to meet site requirements. The double helical gears have hardened teeth and are precision ground to ensure silent running and long working life. For direct drive to centrifugal pumps and compressors a shaft speed of 6,600 rev/min is provided. The engine is mounted on an under base with extended platforms on which the auxiliary components are installed. This also forms the lubricating oil tank.",

            "While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world. ",
            "Today, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs.",
            "By mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed.",
            "Storing fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage.",

Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets.",
            "Also, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability. ",

        "content": [
            "75% of global CO₂ emissions in the power generation sector are caused by coal power plants. Converting coal-fired power plants into highly efficient combined cycle plants can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 70%. It also gives you the option to co-fire clean hydrogen in your gas turbine, enabling you to decarbonize your plant operation even further. ",
            "Based on the Brownfield Transformation concept, our approach includes repurposing as much of your existing infrastructure as possible to enable a fast transition towards a new energy system while reducing CO₂ emissions at the same time. ",
            "A full repowering entails not just changing the fuel from coal or oil to gas but converting the steam power plant to a highly efficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) by reusing infrastructure, site permits and local personnel. Not only is this approach faster and more sustainable but it also saves up to 30% of Capex compared to building a new power plant.",
            "There are two options to repower your plant: the indoor and the outdoor approach.",
            "With the indoor approach, you can reuse most of the existing infrastructure such as foundations, connections, housing and piping. This saves time and costs. With the outdoor approach, you can start building in parallel when the existing plant is still running to secure critical supplies.",
            "In principle, a \"full repowering\" means that one or more gas turbines with downstream heat recovery steam generators replace the old steam generator previously fired with coal or oil. In order to achieve this, various modifications of the steam cycle are necessary, as well as the exchange and retrofit of various components. ",
            "For a full repowering, one needs to make sure that the appropriate gas capacities are available. For the final plan, other factors to be considered are the plant capacity, the heat quantities, and levels to be supplied for district heating and/or process steam applications. Also, one needs to consider the space available, and the condition of the power plant. The overall aim is to keep as much of the existing infrastructure as possible. ",
            "While it is impressive that by converting a conventional coal power plant to a CCPP CO₂ emissions get reduced by up to 70%, it’s worth mentioning that this is a result not just from the fuel switch, but also from an increase in the power plant’s efficiency from an average of 38% to up to 63%.",
            "A boiler conversion involves a modification of the burner technology and a change of coal or oil to gas. While switching to gas as a fuel does not increase the efficiency of the steam plant, it does reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 50%.",
            "‘Topping’ requires the installation of a small gas turbine, regardless of whether the fuel is switched from coal to gas or not. The thermal energy contained in the flue gas of the ‘topping’ gas turbine is fed directly to the steam generator of the existing plant. This results in a slight improvement in overall plant efficiency. ",
            "Boosting requires the installation of an additional – usually medium – gas turbine and a waste heat boiler. In contrast to topping, the heat energy contained in the flue gas of the gas turbine is used with the aid of a heat exchanger to generate high-pressure steam and to preheat the feed water of the existing process. Boosting makes the steam power plant more flexible, while also increasing efficiency and reducing CO₂ emissions.",
            "Parallel repowering utilizes the steam contained in the flue gas of a newly installed large gas turbine with the aid of a heat recovery steam generator for additional feedwater preheating and steam generation in the existing steam power plant process. This conversion also serves to increase the flexibility and efficiency of steam power plants, but to a greater degree than boosting.",
            "Understanding customer’s market environment, the regional energy system and regulatory framework in order to create a customized cost-optimized, efficient, or flexible solution, while aiming at the same time at integrating as many existing assets as possible.",
            "Analyzing how to integrate the new equipment – such as gas turbines or generators – fit into the existing plant layout and infrastructure. Especially for indoor solutions, it’s important to analyze how existing foundations, piping and connections can be reused, while ensuring the new setup will work smoothly and safely. ",
            "Identifying the best configuration with the best thermodynamic fit in order to match the future operating regime with the intended business model. This can involve various, far-reaching measures, as, e.g., the steam cycle of a conventional steam power plant differs fundamentally from that of a CCPP. ",
            "Adapting the existing steam turbine and generator to operating parameters of a combined cycle plant. This may concern especially higher temperatures – up to 600°C and more for a steam turbine – that modern CCPPs use today.",
            "Is your plant a good candidate for coal-to-gas repowering? Answer the following questions to find out.",

        "content": [
            "While it is obvious that a refurbishment of high-voltage components is needed at some point, the right time as well as scope needs to be defined. There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably.",
            "Basically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment.",
            "HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime.",
            "Thanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably.",
            "Grid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects.",
            "Refurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system. ",
            "Three basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies.",
            "High-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio:",
            "Reasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components.",
            "Siemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan. ",
            "No refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project.",
            "Siemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support.",
            "Finding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system.",
            "While regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance. ",
            "Siemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects.",
            "The Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security. In a nutshell: Partnering with Siemens Energy makes sure that your refurbishment project will be a complete success.       "

            "The current trend towards inverter-based power supplies, including renewables, batteries and other solutions, is changing the role of power electronics in the grid. As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​",
            "The ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​",

            "For that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically.",
            "While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world. ",
            "Today, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs.",
            "By mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed.",
            "Storing fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage.",

They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets.",
            "Also, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability. ",
            "But a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption.

            "The lifespan of a transformer largely depends on the ageing of the solid and liquid organic insulating materials. In normal operating conditions, below the maximum permissible load, and with regular maintenance and care, a transformer's lifespan can be extended to well over 30 years.",
            "Nevertheless, during the working life of a transformer abnormal events could occur, for example transient over voltages, overheating during emergency operation, dynamic stress and faults in the cooling. These processes result in an accelerated ageing of the transformer materials.",
            "Whether it is a case of new construction, operation, retrofit or repair, it is always a matter of reliably recognizing material degradation and rectifying it. For this purpose an extensive knowledge of the materials as well as a specific, precise analysis is fundamental. In order to avoid costly breakdowns, minimize downtimes and extend the lifespan of a transformer, the performance of a regular trend analysis and targeted maintenance are indispensable.",
            "The combination of moisture in the oil and in the cellulose is an indicator of ageing. The most important method for the diagnosis of the ageing process as a result of dielectric, thermal, dynamic and chemical ageing in oil and oil-paper insulation is the Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). The Siemens Energy Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers a comprehensive service, from the collection of samples to analysis and assessment.",

The rate of decomposition and the type of gases change during defective operation, which could be a result of thermal overloading and/or electrical faults. Based on the quantity or type of fault gases, the gas increase rates and the proportions between the gases, the type of failure can be deduced.",

In temperatures between 300-700°C ethylene and propylene accompanied by larger quantities of CO and CO2 prevail. Over 700°C mainly ethylene, propylene and hydrogen form, and above 1000°C acetylene are also formed. Electrical discharges (arcs and spark discharges) cause separation of hydrogen and acetylene, as well as methane and ethylene. By thermal-oxidative cellulose degradation, larger quantities of CO and CO2 are formed.",

            "The maintenance of insulating liquids is based on IEC norm, VDE 0370 part 2 (= IEC 60422). This norm is valid for oils that are already contained in transformers. For new oil the norm VDE 0370 part 1 (= IEC 60296) is valid.",
            "The following oil values are decisive for the regulation of measures:",
            "The color and appearance of transformer oil are useful for comparative evaluation: a quick color darkening or dark oil is a sign of oil ageing. The analyzed oil color is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 8, whereby the level of discoloration is indicated by means of the rising color number. ",
            "By analyzing the appearance, undesirable by-products can be detected. Cloudiness or sediment indicate free water, insoluble sludge or dirt particles. If these are present, then also the breakdown voltage and/or the loss factor and eventually also other oil values are out of the norm and measures must be taken.",
            "The breakdown voltage (Ud) indicates how well insulating oil can withstand an electrical load and is therefore decisive for the operational efficiency of a transformer. The breakdown voltage is measured according to VDE 0370 part 5 (=IEC 60156). The initial measures to be taken in case of a drop below the insulation voltage limit values of the relative transformer type, depend on the values of the other characteristic oil values.",
            "Water formation is caused by the ageing of cellulose- insulating material (paper, pressboard, laminated wood), ageing of oil and infiltration of humidity from the environment by means of badly maintained air dryers and/or defective sealing systems.",
            "There is an equilibrium between the water content in oil and the moisture content in the solid insulation, it reduces the breakdown voltage and accelerates the ageing process. This equilibrium though, is temperature and time-dependent.",
            "As there is never an even temperature in an operating transformer, -oil temperature in the tank is much higher at the top than at the bottom, and the same counts for the temperature distribution in the windings – the moisture distribution curves are only a rough estimate. In the moisture distribution curves the water content in the oil can theoretically be distinguished from the moisture content in the cellulose, based on the temperature. This is however valid only for insulation paper and not for pressboard and laminated wood.  A precondition is constant temperature and a set equilibrium.",
            "Through progressive ageing (Oxidation) of the oil, polar decomposition products develop. These deteriorate the dielectric properties of the oil. The result of far advanced oil ageing is sludge formation. Sludge greatly compromises the windings because it leads to the formation of sediments, which prevent heat removal. This heat accumulation in turn causes the winding paper to age intensely. A timely diagnosis of the incipient acid formation is therefore important, so that timely counteractive measures can be initiated.",
            "Literature: Cigre Brochure D1.30 – „Oxidation Stability of Insulating Fluids“",
            "The dielectric dissipation factor of an insulating material is the tangent of the dielectric loss angle.",
            "The dielectric loss angle, is the angle in which the phase difference between the applied voltage and consequential current diverges from π/2 rad, when the capacitor's dielectric comprises only of insulating material.",
            "A rising dissipation factor is an indication of oil ageing or oil contamination. The dissipation factor is strongly influenced by polar components and is therefore a very sensitive parameter.",
            "In addition to the neutralization value and the dissipation factor, interfacial tension is another indicator of sludge formation in the transformer. This test measures the concentration of polar molecules in oil, which form during the ageing process. The higher the concentration, the lower the interfacial tension and the likelier it is for the insulating oil to form sludge.",
            "Inhibitors are age protecting agents which delay the decomposition of the insulating oil. The IEC 60296 accredited inhibitor DBPC (Di-tertiary-butyl-para-cresol), with a weight percentage of 0.25 ± 0.040 , is used. Inhibited oils are preferred for transformers > 200 MVA, for heavily loaded transformers such as traction transformers, for oven transformers or at special customer request. When the accelerated oil ageing process is caused by a transformer malfunction, the original inhibitor content (0,3), can be restored by adding a calculated amount of DBPC in powder form, once the failure has been fixed. Even in the case of normal DBPC- deterioration, the oil can be re-inhibited, although an oil change would be less expensive. This decision can be made only based on the results of the other oil value tests: if these are normal then a re-inhibition can be successful. The inhibitor content is determined using infrared spectrometry or gas chromatography with MS-detector.",
            "The decomposition of paper is caused by the processes of hydrolysis, pyrolysis and oxidation. The degree of polymerization (DP-value) of paper was defined by IEC 60450 and it counts the number of polymerized glucose rings. During the paper decomposition, the DP-value is reduced and the tensile strength decreases. New cellulose has a DP-value of 1000-1100, aged cellulose on the other hand has a value of only 150-200, which means the end of the transformer's lifespan.",
            "As it is not possible to take paper samples during running operation, the condition of the solid insulation is estimated based on the cellulose decomposition products (2- Furfural). For this purpose a regular trend analysis is necessary.",
            "The furan content in oil depends on:",
            "An exact link between the furan content and DP-value cannot be deduced at present. However it is possible to make a trend analysis: based on the change of the furan content, information about thermal conduct of the solid insulation over the years can be obtained.",
            "The testing and approval of new insulating liquids, or mineral oils, synthetic or natural ester or silicone liquids is also part of the laboratory's work.",
            "Using our computer controlled and monitored oxidation equipment we are able to set and monitor the test conditions much more precisely than is required by the standard specifications. The result is a much better reproducibility and safe assessment.",
            "The solid insulating materials in the windings include purified cellulose solid materials like pressboard and insulating paper as well as bonded laminates (e.g. laminated board, various fiber- reinforced synthetic materials).",
            "In the material testing laboratory the physical properties of these materials are tested, hence verifying their applicability for transformer construction.",
            "The following tests are carried out:",
            "Transformer cores are made up of grain-oriented electrical steel. There are three different qualities: conventional grain-oriented steel, highly permeable grain-oriented steel and domain refined electrical steel.",
            "In the material testing laboratory the following tests are carried out on the grain-oriented electrical steel:",
            "Copper materials are mainly used in the windings and in the leads as single flat conductors, multiple flat conductors and continuously transposed conductors. The condition of the enamel paint and of the paper wrapping is decisive for safe transformer operation.",
            "The following tests are carried out on copper materials:",
            "The tank, tank cover, manhole cover and valves of a transformer are sealed using sealing materials that are resistant to insulating liquid, for example:",
            "Outside coating materials are used as corrosion protection for tanks, radiators, coolers and other construction parts. Interior coatings on the other hand are used to protect the transformer from possible metal particle contamination.",

            "In the material testing laboratory we inspect the condition of the coating using the following procedures:",
            "Adhesives, cast resins, desiccants, glide waves and detergents are only some of the numerous auxiliary materials used in transformer production or repair. The behavior of each of these auxiliary materials must be understood to the smallest detail, particularly in their interaction with other materials. We therefore test the adhesion of glues, the adsorption behavior of desiccants and the compatibility of different auxiliary materials with insulating liquids.",

            "A digital lifecycle approach for optimizing offshore Oil and Gas production",
            "With Topsides 4.0 we can help you answer any challenges you might experience, especially in a lower for longer oil price environment. Our engineered expertise is unrivaled in meeting the ever changing needs of EPCs and Owner Operators who are now rethinking how to manage the entire life-cycle of their assets. Siemens Energy has developed Topsides 4.0 - a comprehensive digital life-cycle approach designed to help offshore operators harness the full power of digital transformation for rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, and automation systems. This all starts with digitally configuring solutions jointly with our clients during the conceptual and design phases of their projects, progresses through manufacturing to virtual testing. All delivering an intelligent digital twin of the topsides facility for life cycle decision support and asset optimization. This effectively enables our clients to maximize the performance of critical equipment, and do end-to-end asset optimization.",
            "Topsides 4.0 is a digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems that begins during the conceptual and design phase of a project with the development of a comprehensive digital roadmap. It is during this time that we evaluate how the operator is using data, where the gaps are, and how to best fill them. With that knowledge, Siemens Energy collaborates with the operator and tailors a solution to meet their specific needs.",
            "Topsides 4.0 is designed to help offshore operators realize the full potential of Industry 4.0 and overcome the risks that are inherent in offshore projects by reducing capital and operating costs and shortening facility development cycles. This is achieved through digital project management and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent “Digital Twin” of the topsides facility, which can be used by operators for decision-making support and asset optimization.",
            "Digital solutions have long been applied in other industries to improve efficiency and productivity. The oil and gas industry, however, is just starting to begin its digital transformation. In offshore oil and gas production, many operators are beginning to discover the massive potential digitalization has to offer.",
            "The foundation of Topsides 4.0 is the workflow and data integration of solutions that Siemens Energy has successfully delivered to the oil and gas industry over many years. Although the integrated approach is new, the digital solutions that comprise it have a proven track record of success.",
            "Integral to the Topsides 4.0 approach is the creation of an intelligent digital twin, which is constructed in parallel to the physical topsides during the design and build phases of the project. The digital twin’s intelligence derives from the capability to interpret raw data through a variety of analytics, some of which are automated and others that are offered as an OEM service. The automated analytics are independent of an equipment vendor and based on statistical analysis of real-time data from the instrumentation and automation system.  For critical equipment, such as compressors and turbines, this layer of monitoring can be supplemented with OEM-connected services for predictive diagnostics, spare parts management, and outage planning.",
            "The digital twin is more than a design tool; it’s more than a punch list of parts to fabricate, and it’s more than the 3D model. It’s the joining of the physical and digital worlds as the asset moves through the three phases of a project: FEED and design, configure and build, operate and maintain. ",
            "COMOS Walkinside allows operators to create a series of real-life scenarios in which employees can literally see and experience the tasks they will be required to perform. They can virtually look around, listen, practice, and learn operational procedures at zero financial or physical risk to themselves or the operator. For example, maintenance personnel can view where equipment is located, if it is accessible from the floor, or if scaffolding or a crane is necessary, all in a 3D digital space. Using the link with the COMOS platform, they can directly access equipment characteristics, maintenance history, and documentation by clicking through on the equipment in the 3D view.",
            "The use of a single engineering data hub is a key enabler for digitalization and Topsides 4.0. With appropriate IT security measures, engineering and maintenance contractors, equipment and other providers can all share the as-built and as-maintained data image of the plant. Instead of delivering and attempting to maintain hard copy documentation, the different stakeholders deliver and update their MRB as data records, which simplifies and expedites the process substantially. This creates complete transparency of information for each plant object and ultimately optimizes the design process.",
            "The digital revolution has led to significant performance improvements for producers who are harnessing data-driven solutions; however, despite the largely positive developments, connecting critical equipment to cloud-based platforms does mean that the oil and gas industry must be prepared to respond to an evolving security landscape in which cyber threats are the norm. This is particularly critical when extending the operation of the platform to an onshore location, as is the case with Topsides 4.0.",
            "A key differentiator of Topsides 4.0 is that all electrical, instrumentation, control, and telecommunications (EICT) systems and equipment are integrated into one cybersecure solution. The EICT design establishes a resilient, reliable, and scalable system backbone and architecture to enable safe operation of the topsides facility from an onshore control center. ",

Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.       ",

            "With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, this 72.5 - 145 kV circuit breaker makes a greener grid achievable",
            "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker.",
            "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. ",
            "The only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.",
            "The clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.",
