            "Siemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens.",
            "With the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system.",
            "Your advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC",
            "The synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent.",
            "The SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control, and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC.",
            "SISHIP BlueDrive Eco combines the experience from both systems SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC and SISHIP EcoProp.

The cubicles can be easily lined up to the total required battery capacity.",
            "A fundamental requirement of submarines is to run silently and remain submerged in certain situations. Conventional diesel-electric drive models need to periodically surface to recharge their batteries, making the boat vulnerable. Our PEM fuel cells deliver an atmospheric air-independent, noiseless propulsion solution for power generation on board that can extend the dive time by several weeks.",
            "The PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be extended to weeks, if required, which significantly minimizes the risk of being detected. That’s because the PEM fuel cell modules use oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity, so the potential dive time is restricted only by the supply of stored media and the boat’s energy demand. The system works without atmospheric air and is completely exhaust-free.",
            "Another important advantage is that the PEM fuel cell has an ultimately low signature in operation: This helps reducing the aggregate acoustic signature of the submarine. The system’s noise signature lies well under all threshold values. With their electrochemical properties, the fuel cells themselves operate noiselessly. Even the ancillary units are optimized for low noise or can be easily incorporated into noise encapsulation thanks to their compact design.",
            "Your advantages with PEM fuel cells",
            "The operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system. Our SG-DC supply and switching system delivers a reliable power supply to the propulsion system and the various onboard networks.",
            "To secure the optimum power supply for your boat in any situation, SG-DC ensures the supply, distribution, and monitoring of electrical energy for the propulsion system and all onboard networks. It is the ideal equipment for meeting the specific requirements of submarines with respect to shock and vibration resistance, electromagnetic shielding and acoustics, and external influences such as temperature, air humidity, and air pressure.",
            "SG-DC incorporates the main control panel for connecting the energy producers to the propulsion system, and also the auxiliary power distribution for the individual consumers and all onboard networks. The system is tailored to the individual requirements of every boat and its key characteristics are superb reliability, compact build, and low maintenance.",

            "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker.",
            "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. ",
            "The only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.",
            "The clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.",

Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%.

            "For maximum efficiency, it often makes sense to combine different technologies. To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H).",
            "As most of the factors influencing the technology choice depend on the location of the heating network, there is no one-fits-all solution. However, a pre-selection of suitable technologies can be done, based on the temperature level that is required for the specific application. The matrix below shows the temperature level that can be achieved with different technologies.",

            "Repurposing existing power plants or heating plants can substantially contribute to decarbonizing your assets. A heating plant can be transformed into a cogeneration plant, and a thermal power plant can be turned into a CHP plant. Alternatively, you can convert the complete thermal plant into a Power to Heat application.",
            "With our Brownfield transformation approach, you can convert existing assets within a short time frame into a low-carbon facility while re-using the existing infrastructure as much as possible.\n",
            "Power-to-heat (P2H) systems signal a paradigm shift in the capabilities of low-carbon energy systems. Since heat pumps or electric boilers can be exclusively powered by green electricity, it allows the integration of renewable energy sources in heat energy production—an integration that is both crucial and long overdue.",
            "By adjusting their heat output in response to variations in renewable energy generation, power-to-heat systems can also provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Power-to-heat systems convert surplus renewable energy into usable thermal energy for local or central heating and cooling needs.\n",
            "Due to their high Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat pumps provide low carbon heat. They are completely carbon neutral when powered entirely by renewable energy. ",
            "Heat can be stored significantly more cost effectively than electricity. The combination of P2H with CHP stabilizes the power market. Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time. At peak heat demand it is possible to operate the heat pump together with the CHP plant.",

            "The formation of hydrates is a well-known problem in subsea production systems for oil and gas. When the pipeline content (mix of oil and water) cools down, the temperature is approaching the ambient seawater temperature.",
            "This can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius.",
            "Traditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits. ",
            "Siemens Energy offers DEH power supply systems to prevent hydrate formation during planned and unplanned process shutdown. ",
            "Our systems will contribute to a consistent flow of hydrocarbons despite challenging fluid characteristics and temperature conditions at the seabed. The respective modules of the systems may contain power electronic components as well as control and protection units for the topside equipment and subsea pipeline to be installed on the platform deck.",
            "The systems are designed to control, compensate and balance the single-phase electrical load that the pipeline and the piggyback cable constitute. Each of the systems is customized to the power requirements and electrical properties of the specified subsea load, in both “heat-up” and “maintain heat” mode. The systems are designed to be optimally tuned at any load condition to ensure an excellent power factor, low harmonic feedback, and to have low negative sequence current - important for minimal impact to the platform power grid.",
            "Auxiliary systems for fiber-optic temperature monitoring of the piggyback cables are offered optionally, as well as solutions for remote connection to the modules’ control and protection system via a secure internet connection. ",

            "How to increase transmission system capacity and stability: The ongoing transformation of the energy system requires effective means to cope with growing challenges when it comes to reliable power transmission. Instead of building new lines to provide sufficient transmission capacity, it’s often better to use our flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) technology to increase the transmission capacity. Both newly built transmission lines and existing systems benefit from Siemens Energy’ FSC which is part of the series compensation (SC) solutions that also help to improve the quality and stability of power transmission lines.",
            "Innovative series compensation technology provides higher transmission capacities for existing long-distance AC transmission lines and increased grid stability without the costs and time-requirement of building new lines.",
            "For decades, fixed series capacitor (FSC) technology from Siemens Energy has improved grid stability and contributed to the optimal utilization of transmission lines. Transmission system operators around the world have already benefited from solutions that were tailored to their specific requirements. Among the main benefits of FSC are the reduction of line voltage drops, limitation of load-dependent drops, and a reduction of the transmission angle.",
            "Increased maximum capacity",
            "Fixed series capacitor expands the transmission capacity of lines by compensating the impedance of the overhead line. It’s a cost-efficient way to achieve larger transmission capacities instead of building new lines.",
            "Increased grid stability",
            "With fixed series compensation, it’s possible to provide system stability for bulk power transmission and long transmission lines by reducing voltage drops at the point of connection. This increases overall grid stability.",
            "Economical solution",
            "The fixed series capacitors are the most cost-efficient solution. Their simple, proven and robust technology supports transmission system operators by optimizing power transmission and increasing transmission capacity. Siemens Energy is proud to reiterate: All major components are sourced in-house.",
            "The amount of power that can be transferred with long overhead transmission lines is limited by the impedance that can lead to voltage drops. For decades, fixed series compensation is the proven solution to maintain a minimum voltage profile and maximize utilization of transmission lines. ",
            "It works by connecting a capacitor bank in series with the transmission line to partially compensate the inductive impedance of the line while also increasing the voltage at the point of connection. The capacitors are protected by metal-oxide varistors (MOV) and – in case of a fault – by tripping the FSC and closing the bypass breaker. For instant protection, a triggered spark gap bypasses capacitors and MOVs within less than 1 ms. Even gap-less solutions are possible, provided that local requirements match. Due to this complexity Siemens Energy recommends and offers individually designed solutions with fixed series capacitors."

            "Concentrated solar thermal power is worldwide becoming a more and more important source for power generation. The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field.",
            "Dubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world.",
            "Since the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats.",
            "The basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency.",
            "With our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling.",
            "Parabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam.",
            "The parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants.",
            "A circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine.",
            "The advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field. This means that higher working fluid temperatures in the receiver (up to 1000°C) and better steam parameters are feasible, even supercritical steam is expected.",
            "The number of concentrated solar power plants has increased tremendously in the past ten years. Today we see many different regimes of operations, each of which poses a different challenge to power generation equipment. The design of each steam turbine is adapted to these challenges.",

            "Day and night cycle often requires a large number of starts and fast daily startup capabilities from CSP steam turbines. When focusing on annual power production, the short start-up times of the turbines are of great benefit to the CSP plant owner. Daily cycling and temperature variations require special attention.",

            "Are you in need of a reliable, digital (Sensformer), eco-friendly and durable cast-resin transformer? We have an answer for you: CAREPOLE.",
            "CAREPOLE was developed by Siemens Energy for your overhead distribution line networks. CAREPOLE answers the challenges which transformers can possibly meet. Its windings are sealed with cast resin under vacuum, separated from the core, and the insulation is solid and resist the dielectric loads in the distribution network. The cast resin also protects your unit against severe weather conditions. High- and low-voltage bushings are cast in one piece with the windings. This technical design makes CAREPOLE especially reliable and unsusceptible to failures. Do you need an off-load tap changer? We can provide one near one of the top high-voltage bushings. It is set via a patented tap panel when the transformer is de-energized.",

The winding surfaces and core are in direct contact with the ambient air, resulting in efficient natural heat exchange. The frame surrounding the core creates a solid mechanical structure that protects the unit against corrosion and direct sunlight. The frame also serves as a lifting and fastening mechanism for the transformer. A special manufacturing process and advanced sealing compound ensure lownoise operation and perfect contact between frame and core. The core is wound from highquality electrical steel. The solid insulation of CAREPOLE is stable under all weather conditions and prevents moisture from penetrating the windings and core.",

            "One key factor of the energy market is sustainability. CAREPOLE makes power distribution grids safer and more environmentally friendly because it operates without flammable mineral oil-based insulating fluids. The cast resin used as insulation and for the body of the transformer has excellent electrical and mechanical properties, and is environmentally friendly and self­extinguishing. CAREPOLE does not pose any risk to water sources or nature reserves caused by oil leaks, tank explosions, soil contamination or fires in the event of a fault. Besides, CAREPOLE does not lose any fuel in the case of an external fire. These features can reduce the costs of liability insurance. They also increase the reliability of the distribution grid.",
            "CAREPOLE can be ordered with ready-to-use sensors, allowing you to perform your own monitoring. The connectivity system securely transmits operational data to an advanced analytics and visualization platform, providing you real-time insights into asset health and fleet status. With these digital features, potential failures can be quickly identified and addressed. You may even be able to prevent issues by detecting operational irregularities at an early stage. This transparency provided by CAREPOLE increases the reliability of your distribution grid, enabling smarter and more efficient operation.",

            "In the fiber business as in other industries, electrical power supply requirements are becoming more and more complex. In addition to the traditional need to reliably, safely, and economically distribute electricity from the generator or incoming grid down to the consumers, there are new emerging challenges, including the need to implement governmental directives to save power, and to utilize the growing amount of renewable energy that's being fed into the grid, which is making grid control increasingly complex. The latter can result in voltage fluctuations and even cause plant downtime. SIPAPER Power allows you to safely and reliably engineer, plan, and realize your factory power distribution system while providing you with the tools to meet today's new demands and challenges.",
            "At Progroup Paper AG’s paper factory of in Sandersdorf- Brehna, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, one of the most modern paper machines (PM3) is producing high-quality containerboard from wastepaper. We supply the power distribution and electrification, including the Sipaper DCS APL process control system based on Simatic PCS 7, as well as a multi-motor drive solution based on gearless drives with Sipaper Drives APL Standard.",
            "A pulp and paper mill places intensive demands on electricity supply and power management: High electricity loads must be distributed to different energy consumers safely, reliably, and economically. To satisfy these requirements with maximum efficiency, SIPAPER Power acts as a fully integrated electricity supply and power management system in combination with PCS 7 Power Control. It all starts at the planning stage of your paper mill’s new power network with the high, medium, and low voltage switchgear.",
            "SIPAPER Power performs everything – from controlling supply and distribution to open- and closed-loop control of all your loads. It's a fully integrated power distribution and management system for planning and monitoring the power supply for the complete process chain in your paper factory. This also includes a power supply for black starts and emergency power operation. In conjunction with intelligent control and switching devices and our integrated communications network, SIPAPER Power offers the right technical solutions for all of your requirements: high availability, adequate supply capacity, expandability and scalability, consistently high power quality, and environmental compatibility.

            "SIPAPER Power includes all the necessary components to build a complex power distribution system for your mill, including power and distribution transformers, HV, MV, and LV switchgear in AIS or GIS versions, and appropriate protection systems. In addition a fully integrated energy management system (EMS/SCADA) based on Simatic PCS 7 provides you with all the functions you need to reliably monitor and operate  your mill distribution system. The EMS also includes an intelligent load management module that accurately determines the required loads to be shed and a generator management system (GMS) that optimizes your profits by running the generators in the most efficient range.",
            "With SIPAPER Power you benefit from a dual energy-saving concept. First, we implement energy-efficient components that precisely match your requirements: for example, avoiding unnecessary over-rating that makes the components work in an inefficient range. Second, you'll benefit from the EMS/SCADA system that not only offers high transparency by monitoring and controlling the energy flows but also contributes to the overall optimization of energy resources with its generator management system (GMS) – by optimizing the generators to run in the most efficient range and monitoring the automatic load balancing of the turbine generator sets.",
            "Thanks to sophisticated power control technology, SIPAPER Power gives you an overview of all processes in your electrical installations at all times and provides you with essential service information. The system monitors and records all switching processes throughout your entire factory using smart devices like Simocode®, Siprotec control, and fiber-optic networks. This allows you to predict load requirements and inform the operator, or take action to prevent the mill's power demand from rising to unacceptably high load peaks that result in extra charges.",
            "SIPAPER Power stands for power supply solutions from a single source – fully integrated and coordinated, across all voltage levels, and over the entire lifecycle. The network design starts with the collection of all relevant mill data, including consumer power requirements, starting characteristics of large drives, short-circuit capacity of all components, and grid parameters. Other criteria need to be considered in the engineering,for example, emergency and back-up concepts, mill availability and grid requirements. Finally to verify the mill's design and optimize the recovery time after a mill network or grid supply fault, dynamic network simulations based on fault scenarios are created to guarantee maximum reliability.",
            "Our Industry Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle, and allow you to exploit the opportunities of digitalization while reducing your total cost of ownership.",

            "Industrial heat pumps are an efficient and cost-effective solution for the generation of heat and cold. They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do.",
            "As one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours. ",
            "During the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat. ",

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. ",

            "The maritime sector represents about 13.5% the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at EU level (Source: EEA, 2021). In order to foster decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector, the IMO fixed a target of 80% cut of GHG emissions until 2050 and cut of 100% until 2100. The path towards decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector will also lead to the reduction and/or abatement of pollutants like CO, NOX, SOX, PM, BC, HC that are emitted by fossil fuels combustion. The installation of a methanol reformer coupled to a HTPEM fuel cell could represent an interesting solution as auxiliary power unit of yachts and superyachts, to cover the hotel load but also to sustain slow speed cruising and maneuvering operations in ports.",
            "Aim of the LIFE OCEAN (onboard clean energy and no-noise) project is to substitute the traditional diesel generators used to cover the hotel loads of a Sanlorenzo superyacht with a methanol-based fuel cell system. Along with air pollution mitigation, on board noise will be abated while underwater noise will be reduced thanks to the elimination of diesel generators. The solution adopted constitutes a zero-carbon technology for the maritime sector, adopting green methanol whose large capacity production is growing at both EU and extra-EU level.",
            "Instead of methanol the project will foster the adoption of green methanol (methanol produced by renewable sources, i.e. from agricultural and forestry residues, biogas, organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, synthesis of H2 produced from electrolytic processes and CO2 coming from carbon capture technologies).",
            "Furthermore, methanol is easy to store and handle, it is biodegradable and does not contain sulphur. It is liquid at environmental temperature and pressure, it presents a good energy density (around 22 MJ/kg) and does not need cryogenic tanks for its storage like LNG. ",
            "1. Step\nFirst, the sustainable produced methanol needs to be mixed with water to enable the electrochemical reaction in the reformer. To safe space, weight and hence energy on the vessel it is our goal to find a solution to reuse the water produced in the fuel cell instead of installing a water tank. Resulting in an onboard water cycle and savings of this valuable resource.\n",

            "While it is obvious that a refurbishment of high-voltage components is needed at some point, the right time as well as scope needs to be defined. There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably.",
            "Basically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment.",
            "HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime.",
            "Thanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably.",
            "Grid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects.",
            "Refurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system. ",
            "Three basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies.",
            "High-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio:",
            "Reasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components.",
            "Siemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan. ",
            "No refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project.",
            "Siemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support.",
            "Finding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system.",
            "While regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance. ",
            "Siemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects.",
            "The Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security. In a nutshell: Partnering with Siemens Energy makes sure that your refurbishment project will be a complete success.       "

That means you can remain flexible and independent over the long run.",
            "Mining is all about raw materials. When it comes to competition, it is production costs that matter – and energy costs are a key factor. The remote regions where raw materials are extracted are often not connected to public power networks. An on-site supply requires flexible facilities that can deliver power under tough conditions at low cost. Whether it’s for open-cast or underground mining, in cold or hot environments, as a standalone system or a back-up for renewable sources – we will design and build exactly the power plant solution you need to bolster your competitive position.",
            "Safety is paramount in chemical processes, and outages are both risky and costly – so your electricity supply must be totally reliable. This works best if you have your own generating system on-site, which will make you independent of external suppliers and curb costs in the long term. If a power plant also permits heat extraction, all the better – that will make your entire system even more efficient. We build the right solution for you – and integrate it seamlessly into your chain of processes.",
            "The energy landscape is changing. Small gas-fired power plants will be a mainstay of our energy supply system for the foreseeable future. That’s because they can serve as a flexible back-up for renewables, they’re highly efficient and operate reliably, and they can enable regions to function independently. On islands or at remote industrial sites, covering basic load or peak, with or without heat extraction – our industrial power plant solution will perfectly suit your specific requirements.",
            "The SGT-800 is the flagship of the Siemens portfolio of industrial gas turbines and provides excellent performance in combined cycle operation. It has proven itself in grid support and as a reliable backup for renewable energy sources. It is equally well-suited for independently supplying an industrial facility, with or without a grid connection. You can build on a fleet availability of over 97 percent.",
            "Get even more out of the energy in your fuel: A steam generator will use waste heat from the gas turbine to generate steam, which can drive a steam turbine. Combined cycle operation pays off.",
            "New gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability. ",

Two sleeve bearings are used to carry the rotating assembly supported by the stator casing at the turbine end and the inlet casing at the compressor end. An anti-whirl type bearing is ﬁtted at the compressor turbine end of the assembly and thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined double acting tilting pad bearing. Separate grooved discs are clamped together with a single through bolt to make up the rotor assembly. Stator blades are retained by dovetail roots in grooves machined on the stator casing which is split on the horizontal centre line to facilitate inspection of the rotor and stator assemblies.",

            "Power Turbine The discs of the two-stage free power turbine and the rotor blades are manufactured from alloys to meet the engine duty. The blades are ﬁxed into the discs by the traditional ﬁr tree root method and secured by peening. The use of two stages gives low stress levels and maintains a safe overspeed capability. There are no critical speeds within the operating speed range. Two sleeve bearings support the power turbine rotor shaft which are carried in the robust gear casting to which is secured the support arm for the stator casing. Thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined tilting pad thrust bearing.",
            "Control system The compensating hydraulic governor, that controls the quantity of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber, is gear driven from the power turbine. It controls the turbine over the full power range and allows output speed to be controlled. Starting may be either from a 24-volt D.C. electric motor or by a gas starter motor driving through a Bendix drive on to the turbine axial compressor shaft. When operating on gaseous fuels the pilot igniter can be supplied with gas from the main fuel system via a pressure reducing valve. For engines burning liquid fuel the igniter gas supply is taken from a gas bottle or similar source of supply. The control equipment is housed in two cabinets mounted in the turbine under base, the hydraulic control cabinet housing the engine instruments, pressure switches a servo system component while the electrical control cabinet contains the associated relays, timers, wiring and terminals, the selection switches, the annunciator panel, and the T Max temperature indicator. ",

The main engine pump is driven through the auxiliary gear train from the output shaft. Oil cooling is by either an air blast or water-cooled cooler to meet site requirements. The double helical gears have hardened teeth and are precision ground to ensure silent running and long working life. For direct drive to centrifugal pumps and compressors a shaft speed of 6,600 rev/min is provided. The engine is mounted on an under base with extended platforms on which the auxiliary components are installed. This also forms the lubricating oil tank.",
            "Inspection of the internal components of the TA gas turbine is necessary only when a blade inspection is due, usually after 20,000 to 30,000 hours (3 years) running. The turbine can be rapidly opened for such inspections and can be carried out at site. The turbine rotors are retained by a single through bolt which is quickly removed to permit withdrawal of both compressor and power turbines. "

            "For that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically.",
            "While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world. ",
            "Today, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs.",
            "By mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed.",
            "Storing fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage.",
            "When it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible.",

They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets.",
            "Also, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability. ",
            "But a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption.

            "75% of global CO₂ emissions in the power generation sector are caused by coal power plants. Converting coal-fired power plants into highly efficient combined cycle plants can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 70%. It also gives you the option to co-fire clean hydrogen in your gas turbine, enabling you to decarbonize your plant operation even further. ",
            "Based on the Brownfield Transformation concept, our approach includes repurposing as much of your existing infrastructure as possible to enable a fast transition towards a new energy system while reducing CO₂ emissions at the same time. ",
            "A full repowering entails not just changing the fuel from coal or oil to gas but converting the steam power plant to a highly efficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) by reusing infrastructure, site permits and local personnel. Not only is this approach faster and more sustainable but it also saves up to 30% of Capex compared to building a new power plant.",
            "There are two options to repower your plant: the indoor and the outdoor approach.",
            "With the indoor approach, you can reuse most of the existing infrastructure such as foundations, connections, housing and piping. This saves time and costs. With the outdoor approach, you can start building in parallel when the existing plant is still running to secure critical supplies.",
            "In principle, a \"full repowering\" means that one or more gas turbines with downstream heat recovery steam generators replace the old steam generator previously fired with coal or oil. In order to achieve this, various modifications of the steam cycle are necessary, as well as the exchange and retrofit of various components. ",
            "For a full repowering, one needs to make sure that the appropriate gas capacities are available. For the final plan, other factors to be considered are the plant capacity, the heat quantities, and levels to be supplied for district heating and/or process steam applications. Also, one needs to consider the space available, and the condition of the power plant. The overall aim is to keep as much of the existing infrastructure as possible. ",
            "While it is impressive that by converting a conventional coal power plant to a CCPP CO₂ emissions get reduced by up to 70%, it’s worth mentioning that this is a result not just from the fuel switch, but also from an increase in the power plant’s efficiency from an average of 38% to up to 63%.",
            "A boiler conversion involves a modification of the burner technology and a change of coal or oil to gas. While switching to gas as a fuel does not increase the efficiency of the steam plant, it does reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 50%.",
            "‘Topping’ requires the installation of a small gas turbine, regardless of whether the fuel is switched from coal to gas or not. The thermal energy contained in the flue gas of the ‘topping’ gas turbine is fed directly to the steam generator of the existing plant. This results in a slight improvement in overall plant efficiency. ",
            "Boosting requires the installation of an additional – usually medium – gas turbine and a waste heat boiler. In contrast to topping, the heat energy contained in the flue gas of the gas turbine is used with the aid of a heat exchanger to generate high-pressure steam and to preheat the feed water of the existing process. Boosting makes the steam power plant more flexible, while also increasing efficiency and reducing CO₂ emissions.",

            "For that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically.",
            "While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world. ",
            "Today, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs.",
            "By mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed.",
            "Storing fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage.",
            "When it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible.",
            "For ELEC, everything revolves around the topic of energy. No wonder, after all, he lives in a light bulb. Bursting with questions on the energy transition, he wants to know why storage solutions are so important on our way towards a CO₂-free economy. Watch the video for more.",

            "The situation energy producers, distributers and industrial consumers find themselves in is by no means easy. They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets.",
            "Also, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability. ",
            "But a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption. The production of green hydrogen also requires renewable energy sources, but if none are available, energy still needs to be at hand to manufacture it. ",

            "The lifespan of a transformer largely depends on the ageing of the solid and liquid organic insulating materials. In normal operating conditions, below the maximum permissible load, and with regular maintenance and care, a transformer's lifespan can be extended to well over 30 years.",
            "Nevertheless, during the working life of a transformer abnormal events could occur, for example transient over voltages, overheating during emergency operation, dynamic stress and faults in the cooling. These processes result in an accelerated ageing of the transformer materials.",
            "Whether it is a case of new construction, operation, retrofit or repair, it is always a matter of reliably recognizing material degradation and rectifying it. For this purpose an extensive knowledge of the materials as well as a specific, precise analysis is fundamental. In order to avoid costly breakdowns, minimize downtimes and extend the lifespan of a transformer, the performance of a regular trend analysis and targeted maintenance are indispensable.",
            "The combination of moisture in the oil and in the cellulose is an indicator of ageing. The most important method for the diagnosis of the ageing process as a result of dielectric, thermal, dynamic and chemical ageing in oil and oil-paper insulation is the Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). The Siemens Energy Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers a comprehensive service, from the collection of samples to analysis and assessment.",

            "During the natural aging process of the oil and insulating parts, especially in the case of thermal or electrical failures, cracked gases form, and are dissolved in the oil. The rate of decomposition and the type of gases change during defective operation, which could be a result of thermal overloading and/or electrical faults. Based on the quantity or type of fault gases, the gas increase rates and the proportions between the gases, the type of failure can be deduced.",
            "Partial discharges with lower energy mainly lead to the formation of hydrogen and methane, as well as small quantities of ethane. Thermal overheating results in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. In temperatures between 300-700°C ethylene and propylene accompanied by larger quantities of CO and CO2 prevail. Over 700°C mainly ethylene, propylene and hydrogen form, and above 1000°C acetylene are also formed. Electrical discharges (arcs and spark discharges) cause separation of hydrogen and acetylene, as well as methane and ethylene. By thermal-oxidative cellulose degradation, larger quantities of CO and CO2 are formed.",
            "Through DGA mainly slowly developing faults can be detected.

            "The maintenance of insulating liquids is based on IEC norm, VDE 0370 part 2 (= IEC 60422). This norm is valid for oils that are already contained in transformers. For new oil the norm VDE 0370 part 1 (= IEC 60296) is valid.",
            "The following oil values are decisive for the regulation of measures:",
            "The color and appearance of transformer oil are useful for comparative evaluation: a quick color darkening or dark oil is a sign of oil ageing. The analyzed oil color is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 8, whereby the level of discoloration is indicated by means of the rising color number. ",
            "By analyzing the appearance, undesirable by-products can be detected. Cloudiness or sediment indicate free water, insoluble sludge or dirt particles. If these are present, then also the breakdown voltage and/or the loss factor and eventually also other oil values are out of the norm and measures must be taken.",
            "The breakdown voltage (Ud) indicates how well insulating oil can withstand an electrical load and is therefore decisive for the operational efficiency of a transformer. The breakdown voltage is measured according to VDE 0370 part 5 (=IEC 60156). The initial measures to be taken in case of a drop below the insulation voltage limit values of the relative transformer type, depend on the values of the other characteristic oil values.",
            "Water formation is caused by the ageing of cellulose- insulating material (paper, pressboard, laminated wood), ageing of oil and infiltration of humidity from the environment by means of badly maintained air dryers and/or defective sealing systems.",
            "There is an equilibrium between the water content in oil and the moisture content in the solid insulation, it reduces the breakdown voltage and accelerates the ageing process. This equilibrium though, is temperature and time-dependent.",
            "As there is never an even temperature in an operating transformer, -oil temperature in the tank is much higher at the top than at the bottom, and the same counts for the temperature distribution in the windings – the moisture distribution curves are only a rough estimate. In the moisture distribution curves the water content in the oil can theoretically be distinguished from the moisture content in the cellulose, based on the temperature. This is however valid only for insulation paper and not for pressboard and laminated wood.  A precondition is constant temperature and a set equilibrium.",
            "Through progressive ageing (Oxidation) of the oil, polar decomposition products develop. These deteriorate the dielectric properties of the oil. The result of far advanced oil ageing is sludge formation. Sludge greatly compromises the windings because it leads to the formation of sediments, which prevent heat removal. This heat accumulation in turn causes the winding paper to age intensely. A timely diagnosis of the incipient acid formation is therefore important, so that timely counteractive measures can be initiated.",

            "A rising dissipation factor is an indication of oil ageing or oil contamination. The dissipation factor is strongly influenced by polar components and is therefore a very sensitive parameter.",
            "In addition to the neutralization value and the dissipation factor, interfacial tension is another indicator of sludge formation in the transformer. This test measures the concentration of polar molecules in oil, which form during the ageing process. The higher the concentration, the lower the interfacial tension and the likelier it is for the insulating oil to form sludge.",
            "Inhibitors are age protecting agents which delay the decomposition of the insulating oil. The IEC 60296 accredited inhibitor DBPC (Di-tertiary-butyl-para-cresol), with a weight percentage of 0.25 ± 0.040 , is used. Inhibited oils are preferred for transformers > 200 MVA, for heavily loaded transformers such as traction transformers, for oven transformers or at special customer request. When the accelerated oil ageing process is caused by a transformer malfunction, the original inhibitor content (0,3), can be restored by adding a calculated amount of DBPC in powder form, once the failure has been fixed. Even in the case of normal DBPC- deterioration, the oil can be re-inhibited, although an oil change would be less expensive. This decision can be made only based on the results of the other oil value tests: if these are normal then a re-inhibition can be successful. The inhibitor content is determined using infrared spectrometry or gas chromatography with MS-detector.",
            "The decomposition of paper is caused by the processes of hydrolysis, pyrolysis and oxidation. The degree of polymerization (DP-value) of paper was defined by IEC 60450 and it counts the number of polymerized glucose rings. During the paper decomposition, the DP-value is reduced and the tensile strength decreases. New cellulose has a DP-value of 1000-1100, aged cellulose on the other hand has a value of only 150-200, which means the end of the transformer's lifespan.",
            "As it is not possible to take paper samples during running operation, the condition of the solid insulation is estimated based on the cellulose decomposition products (2- Furfural). For this purpose a regular trend analysis is necessary.",

            "It is often impossible to put a price on the value of water, especially in regions where water is a scarce resource",
            "Our Heat ReCycle solution is comprised of a gas turbine power plant with Organic Rankine Cycle- (ORC) technology. The combination of proven gas turbine and ORC technology for efficient recovery of waste heat is our response to the market challenges which various regions of the world are facing today. One billion people do not have any access to electricity, and another billion have a lack of reliable power supply; especially ones that are located in remote and isolated areas. Offering affordable electricity while taking the environment with water-free operation into account can be achieved with a reliable Heat ReCycle power plant solution.",

            "Heat ReCycle offers electricity at the best possible cost over its lifetime while maintaining high efficiency. This means that both people and industries will have access to affordable energy for their daily needs.",
            "From an environmental perspective, highly efficient Heat ReCycle power plants produce lower emissions when compared to other technology that is typically used in remote areas, like diesel generators and reciprocating engines, resulting in lower NOx, CO2 and Unburned Hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions.\n",
            "From an environmental perspective, highly efficient Heat ReCycle power plants produce lower emissions when compared to other technology that is typically used in remote areas, like diesel generators and reciprocating engines, resulting in lower NOx, CO2 and Unburned Hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions.",
            "Through the efficient combustion of fuel, the gas turbine generates electricity and produces hot exhaust gas. The thermal energy in the hot exhaust gas is recovered through a Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU), using an organic fluid as the heat exchange medium. The hot organic fluid is used to power an ORC-turbine and generator to generate additional electricity. This combined cycle characterizes itself with simplicity compared to a water-/steam-cycle, at the same time completely eliminating the need for water at all.",
            "The Organic Rankine Cycle's principle is based on a turbogenerator working as a conventional steam turbine to transform thermal energy into mechanical energy and finally into electrical energy through an electrical generator. Instead of generating steam from water, the ORC system vaporizes an organic fluid, characterized by a molecular mass higher than that of water, which leads to a slower rotation of the turbine, lower pressures and no erosion of the metal parts and blades.",
            "The Heat ReCycle range of power plants provides a wide choice of different industrial and aeroderivative gas turbines. The power plant can be customized for the required project-specific boundaries, such as power output and operating load regime. Heat ReCycle power plant configurations are possible from roughly 10 to almost 100 MWe capacity.",
            "The 3 x SGT-400 Heat ReCycle reference configuration is used as an example for explaining this new power plant in further detail. Having a three-on-one (3 gas turbines on 1 ORC turbine) configuration in the typical 50-MW capacity size range enables operational flexibility. Especially for remote locations, the 50-MW size range has traditionally been served by reciprocating engines or simple cycle gas turbines. Now, Heat ReCycle offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative, while providing a great deal of flexibility through this multi-unit set-up. ",
            "The total power plant output of this configuration is in the range of roughly 52 - 58 MW, depending on the GT version and project conditions. See more plant details in the below table:",
            "The Heat ReCycle 3 x SGT-400 configuration provides flexible, reliable and affordable power while complying with the most stringent emissions standards globally. The multi-unit set-up allows for a great deal of flexibility and plant part load capability while also reaching high efficiencies with the ORC bottoming-cycle. This 50 MW-range power plant is unique in its kind and is competitive against reciprocating engines in the same power range. The benefits include a very high power-density, attractive CAPEX, and better LCoE than similar power solutions for intermediate to base load power generation.",
            "The SGT-400 is a simple, robust twin-shaft gas turbine, suitable for all climates and serves a power band of 10 – 15 MW. The SGT-400 is a leader in operational and fuel flexibility, low emissions, and overall efficiency. A wide range of fuel compositions can be burned while running efficiently at all loads. The turbine can meet stringent emission standards while operating as low as 30% load, and has seamless, true dual-fuel capability. With more than 390 units installed all over the globe and more than 5 million actual operating hours, it is an excellent fit to the Heat ReCycle power plant. ",
            "The Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU) offers an efficient method of recovering thermal energy from the waste heat of gas turbine exhaust gases. Unlike a traditional Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), the WHRU is a single stage system using a once-through principle and is therefore less complex. The WHRU has been completely optimized around the gas turbine and is charaterized by its highly modular design for optimal constructability. The complete WHRU can be installed in less than 6 weeks and offers the lowest total installed cost.",

Combined with sliding pressure operation, this allows for highly efficient, flexible, and reliable power plant operation. Our Benson technology and our associated Benson license will improve your specific steam generator and, consequently, benefit your power plant performance. Find out more below or contact us. ",
            "A new Benson HP evaporator design for vertical-exhaust-gas-flow heat recovery steam generators – deployed for the first time in the 24 HRSGs of the Siemens Energy H-class Egypt Megaproject – has proved highly successful. Commissioning and operation have been trouble free, thanks to innovative design features and simulation-based prior optimisation of the all-important Benson-specific feed-water controller. ",
            "Since 1933 leading steam generator manufacturers have constructed Benson steam generators worldwide under Siemens Energy Benson license. Today, our Benson technology is widely used in fired steam generators and heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) of highly efficient modern power plants.",
            "Today combined cycle gas power plants need to be more efficient and flexible than ever, because they have to both",
            "This is where Benson HRSGs make an important contribution. The unique once-through design enables fast flexible start up of a combined cycle, while maintaining high cycle efficiency. Benson HRSGs can be constructed either horizontally or vertically and will fit into any power plant architecture.  ",
            "Benefits compared with drum-type steam generators",
            "The first combined cycle power plant with a Benson heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) – the 390-MW Cottam CDC, located in Great Britain – was successfully commissioned in 1999. More than 100 Benson heat-recovery steam generators have been commissioned to date or are currently under construction.",
            "The overall efficiency of a steam power plant counts in every respect, whether it’s reducing emissions or increasing economic efficiency. The best way to boost efficiency is by selecting high steam parameters. The once-through principle permits steam generation even at supercritical pressure. To date Benson boilers have been built for pressures up to 310 bar.",
            "Contribution to flexible power plant operation",
            "The Benson steam generator is especially well suited to flexible sliding-pressure operation: A steam power plant with a Benson steam generator can sustain load transients of four to six percent per minute over a wide power output range. High plant efficiency is ensured even at part load.",
            "Sophisticated construction ­– individually optimized",
            "Benson steam generators can be precisely adapted to suit your firing conditions: Different furnace sizes and geometries can be used depending on the fuel used. An important factor here is that the functions on the water/steam side are not restricted. Benson steam generators have been constructed with the broadest possible range of firing systems, including fluidized bed combustion.",
            "Lately, the Benson steam generator with vertical rifled tubes has been successfully established in the market. Based on the Benson Low Mass Flux Design, this type of steam generator combines outstanding operating characteristics with low investment costs and high levels of reliability.",
            "More than 1,300 Benson fired steam generators have been commissioned to date.",
            "Benson steam generators have outstanding operating characteristics and are extremely reliable – thanks to continuous research and development. And we are refining the technology even more: We’re working intensively to optimize the heat transfer, pressure drop, and flow stability of two phase flows in evaporator tubes. Siemens Energy has its own Benson test rig for the trials. The results of the trials have led to the creation of the world’s largest database on heat transfer and pressure drop in evaporator tubes, and support the development and validation of the Siemens Eenrgy Benson design software.",
            "Another key area of focus is the development of Benson-specific control concepts, which make a key contribution to ensuring the best possible operation of your particular system.",
            "In 1925, Siemens acquired the right to use Benson's patent, and in 1926–27 the first large Benson boiler in Berlin-Gartenfeld was built. Siemens improved the technology and developed it as an internationally acknowledged standard for large steam generators. In 1933, Siemens decided that it would no longer manufacture steam generators in its facilities, but would instead award licenses based on its own patents and expertise. This story goes still further:",
            "The Siemens Energy Benson license is available for fired steam generators as well as for heat-recovery steam generators. It primarily addresses the thermodynamic and thermo-hydraulic design of the evaporator system in Benson steam generators. ",

            "A digital lifecycle approach for optimizing offshore Oil and Gas production",
            "With Topsides 4.0 we can help you answer any challenges you might experience, especially in a lower for longer oil price environment. Our engineered expertise is unrivaled in meeting the ever changing needs of EPCs and Owner Operators who are now rethinking how to manage the entire life-cycle of their assets. Siemens Energy has developed Topsides 4.0 - a comprehensive digital life-cycle approach designed to help offshore operators harness the full power of digital transformation for rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, and automation systems. This all starts with digitally configuring solutions jointly with our clients during the conceptual and design phases of their projects, progresses through manufacturing to virtual testing. All delivering an intelligent digital twin of the topsides facility for life cycle decision support and asset optimization. This effectively enables our clients to maximize the performance of critical equipment, and do end-to-end asset optimization.",
            "Topsides 4.0 is a digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems that begins during the conceptual and design phase of a project with the development of a comprehensive digital roadmap. It is during this time that we evaluate how the operator is using data, where the gaps are, and how to best fill them. With that knowledge, Siemens Energy collaborates with the operator and tailors a solution to meet their specific needs.",
            "Topsides 4.0 is designed to help offshore operators realize the full potential of Industry 4.0 and overcome the risks that are inherent in offshore projects by reducing capital and operating costs and shortening facility development cycles. This is achieved through digital project management and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent “Digital Twin” of the topsides facility, which can be used by operators for decision-making support and asset optimization.",
            "Digital solutions have long been applied in other industries to improve efficiency and productivity. The oil and gas industry, however, is just starting to begin its digital transformation. In offshore oil and gas production, many operators are beginning to discover the massive potential digitalization has to offer.",
            "The foundation of Topsides 4.0 is the workflow and data integration of solutions that Siemens Energy has successfully delivered to the oil and gas industry over many years. Although the integrated approach is new, the digital solutions that comprise it have a proven track record of success.",
            "Integral to the Topsides 4.0 approach is the creation of an intelligent digital twin, which is constructed in parallel to the physical topsides during the design and build phases of the project. The digital twin’s intelligence derives from the capability to interpret raw data through a variety of analytics, some of which are automated and others that are offered as an OEM service. The automated analytics are independent of an equipment vendor and based on statistical analysis of real-time data from the instrumentation and automation system.  For critical equipment, such as compressors and turbines, this layer of monitoring can be supplemented with OEM-connected services for predictive diagnostics, spare parts management, and outage planning.",
            "The digital twin is more than a design tool; it’s more than a punch list of parts to fabricate, and it’s more than the 3D model. It’s the joining of the physical and digital worlds as the asset moves through the three phases of a project: FEED and design, configure and build, operate and maintain. ",
            "COMOS Walkinside allows operators to create a series of real-life scenarios in which employees can literally see and experience the tasks they will be required to perform. They can virtually look around, listen, practice, and learn operational procedures at zero financial or physical risk to themselves or the operator. For example, maintenance personnel can view where equipment is located, if it is accessible from the floor, or if scaffolding or a crane is necessary, all in a 3D digital space. Using the link with the COMOS platform, they can directly access equipment characteristics, maintenance history, and documentation by clicking through on the equipment in the 3D view.",
            "The use of a single engineering data hub is a key enabler for digitalization and Topsides 4.0. With appropriate IT security measures, engineering and maintenance contractors, equipment and other providers can all share the as-built and as-maintained data image of the plant. Instead of delivering and attempting to maintain hard copy documentation, the different stakeholders deliver and update their MRB as data records, which simplifies and expedites the process substantially. This creates complete transparency of information for each plant object and ultimately optimizes the design process.",
            "The digital revolution has led to significant performance improvements for producers who are harnessing data-driven solutions; however, despite the largely positive developments, connecting critical equipment to cloud-based platforms does mean that the oil and gas industry must be prepared to respond to an evolving security landscape in which cyber threats are the norm. This is particularly critical when extending the operation of the platform to an onshore location, as is the case with Topsides 4.0.",
            "A key differentiator of Topsides 4.0 is that all electrical, instrumentation, control, and telecommunications (EICT) systems and equipment are integrated into one cybersecure solution. The EICT design establishes a resilient, reliable, and scalable system backbone and architecture to enable safe operation of the topsides facility from an onshore control center. ",
            "The SGT-750 delivers lowest total cost of ownership by reducing fuel costs, maintenance operations and outages. With best-in-class performance, a compact, lightweight design, and the lowest carbon footprint and emissions in the market, with single digit NOx over a wide load range.",

Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.       ",

Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues.",
            "Synchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid.",
            "A synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events.",

            "The formation of hydrates is a well-known problem in subsea production systems for oil and gas. When the pipeline content (mix of oil and water) cools down, the temperature is approaching the ambient seawater temperature.",
            "This can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius.",
            "Traditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits. ",
            "Siemens Energy offers DEH power supply systems to prevent hydrate formation during planned and unplanned process shutdown. ",
            "Our systems will contribute to a consistent flow of hydrocarbons despite challenging fluid characteristics and temperature conditions at the seabed.

Each of the systems is customized to the power requirements and electrical properties of the specified subsea load, in both “heat-up” and “maintain heat” mode. The systems are designed to be optimally tuned at any load condition to ensure an excellent power factor, low harmonic feedback, and to have low negative sequence current - important for minimal impact to the platform power grid.",

            "From power transformers to HVDC transformers, these key components are crucial for a seamless, uninterrupted power supply. Despite their ruggedness and reliability, they are susceptible to aging and wear over their decades of use.",
            "Why Siemens Energy? Transformer Lifecycle Management (TLM) - a strategic way to increase value. TLM allows for targeted expenditure planning and controlled timing of new investments, avoiding unforeseen outages and minimizing planned downtimes. It also reduces environmental impact while maximizing transformer availability. This service concept applies to all transformers in your network, irrespective of age, manufacturer, or power. We service all generations of transformers.  TLM is designed to prevent unplanned downtimes and optimize planned maintenance measures. We recognize that even planned service interruptions have increasingly shorter windows. Our solution includes mobile technologies and methods, with expert teams that provide on-site support. From oil-drying systems to high-voltage testing stations, our mobile repair workshops are fast, flexible, and can be integrated into your operations. This complements the performance spectrum of Siemens Energy's repair facility, enhancing service reliability.",
            "Our time- and condition-based maintenance services follow original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations to slow down the aging process of transformers, extending their lifespan and efficiency. We offer specialized services including oil regeneration, transformer drying, and moisture monitoring to prevent damage and ensure peak performance. Our local qualified experts conduct on-site investigations and provide comprehensive repair solutions, including parts and materials, failure analysis, and on-site transformer repair using a mobile facility for efficiency and convenience.",
            "DIAG ensures the reliability and longevity of transformers through comprehensive diagnostic modules that assess individual transformers and entire fleets. The service offers three levels of assessment, including inspection, diagnostics, and high voltage testing, providing transparent and objective evaluations for informed decision-making. Experienced service professionals provide detailed test reports with recommended actions to prevent unexpected failures and maximize transformer utilization. By utilizing DIAG, transformer owners and operators can optimize maintenance strategies, avoid unplanned outages, and improve overall safety and security of operation.  ",
            "Our services include insulating oil analyses and material testing, which involve diagnostic test procedures for ageing analysis, condition detection, and new state assessments of oils and insulating materials. The lifespan of a transformer depends on the ageing of the insulating materials, and our services aim to recognize material degradation and extend transformer lifespan through trend analysis and targeted maintenance. The Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers comprehensive services, including sample collection, analysis, and assessment, to identify ageing processes and ensure reliable performance.",
            "Depending on the initial situation, it may be expedient from an economic standpoint to have an older or damaged transformer overhauled at one of our Siemens Energy production locations. Based on our experience, an overhaul restores transformer availability for an extended time with no restrictions in operating reliability. There are advantages over the production of a new transformer. An overhaul and restoration are usually significantly more cost-effective and time-efficient. Our customers also experience significantly shorter outage times.",
            "In many cases, it is not possible or cost-effective to bring the transformer to one of our manufacturing plants for repair because of the necessary heavy transport.",
            "In these cases we can offer our customers on-site repair. An individual solution may be elaborated depending on the existing infrastructure.",
            "See the animation:",
            "REG, the online regeneration technology, can clean aged or corrosive transformer oil, restore its dielectric properties, and increase the transformer availability. Regeneration processes requires special equipment, high competence, and long-time experience of staff. Siemens Energy operators have experience in online regeneration of more than 300 transformers with different design, connections and at various ambient temperatures. REG, removes degradation products and corrosive compounds from transformer oil during normal transformer operations. This not only ensures operational efficiency but also offers substantial economic and ecological advantages. ",
            "Power transformers degrade over time, with moisture in the insulating paper hastening this process. This moisture can come from insufficient drying during production, environmental damage, or the degradation process itself. A single oil treatment won't have a lasting effect as 98% of the moisture is in the insulating paper.  Siemens Energy's TLM method effectively slows down the unavoidable aging process within your transformers, thus extending their lifespan. Our widely recognized DRY is a stationary and continuous transformer drying system.",
            "In addition to our repair and maintenance services, we provide modernization of hardware and software with state-of-the-art versions. We also offer retrofitting of individual components to maintain delivery capacity, as well as overhauling transformers to ensure optimal functionality. Furthermore, we provide system-wide feature upgrades and performance enhancements to meet evolving operational needs.",

            "Large electrical consumers in industrial processes often show a very dynamic behavior. Looking at the most extreme case of electrical loads worldwide, Electrical Arc Furnaces (EAFs) – where a single unit can have a consumption of up to around 300 MVA (the consumption of a city of 300.000 inhabitants) – their load characteristic is extremely dynamic and stochastic, creating a number of disturbances to the feeding grid, such as fast voltage fluctuations causing the phenomenon of flickering of light, bad power factor and asymmetric loading of the 3 phases of the supply system, as well generation of harmonics due to the non linear current of the electric arc. To counteract the disturbances of such industrial loads, an innovative and versatile compensation solution for enhancing power quality is required - SVC PLUS® provides the ideal solution. Our advanced STATCOM (static synchronous compensator) with modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology provides additional benefits compared to conventional solutions for load compensation. While conventional SVC installations already provide a highly dynamic solution for power quality improvement at the the grid connection point of an industrial power distribution system, the modular multilevel system SVC PLUS® is even faster and offers multiple additional benefits.

Maintaining power quality parameters on the other hand is often a precondition to connect such a plant to the public grid.",
            "This constellation calls for a compensation system of highest performance. To achieve this task, filter circuits are added in parallel to the multilevel converter (MMC) as in the SVC PLUS® Compact to fully and optimally utilize the complete range of reactive power of the converter.",

            "The SVC PLUS® 2+1 is the Siemens Energy approach to very large industrial electric consumers: Electric arc furnaces nowadays often are in the range of 200MVA – a tough task also for the load compensation system. A combination of 2 SVC PLUS® converters, together with filter circuits where required, is the concept of choice, that also offers highest achievable results in flicker reduction and improvement of other power quality parameters. This solution additionally offers concept-inherent partial mutual backup – in case of a failure of any of the 3 functional groups SVC PLUS® converter 1, converter 2 or filter circuits the faulty functional group is switched off, but the remaining system stays in operation with reduced power, which allows the load to continue operation.",
            "Depending on the actual short circuit power level a power reduction of the load may be necessary, if the grid cannot tolerate temporarily the reduced power quality improvement of the remaining compensation system.",

Both tasks have to be considered in light of increasingly complex grid architectures and fluctuating power infeed from renewable energy sources. For many Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSO), this leads to three major challenges: first, fast reaction to market needs and short lead time of the C&P system. Second, reliable and secure operations throughout the entire lifecycle while safeguarding low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). And last but not least, the C&P system should be easy to expand for new solutions and services.

Thermal overloads in the lines and a growing number of cases in which frequency and voltage come critically close to acceptable range limits, or even exceed them, threaten grid stability and the transmission infrastructure, and often require costly redispatch intervention to deal with current and voltage factors. Compared to traditional power flow controllers, UPFC PLUS® controls power flow in just milliseconds. The unified power flow controller UPFC PLUS® thus stabilizes the AC grid even when critical situations develop suddenly (Grid Code N-1). That means UPFC PLUS® lets you get the most from your existing grid capacity while maintaining maximum protection, reducing the risk of power failures, and minimizing redispatch costs.      ",

Once these generators are shut down, their role in providing rotational inertia, short circuit power and voltage control, to help balance the grid system disappears with them also. Grid stability is, therefore, a vital consideration for transmission and distribution network operators, with increasing renewable penetration.",

By utilizing power plants that may otherwise become stranded assets, RGS conversions provide necessary system inertia, short circuit power and reactive power to the grid for that balance. ",
            "Inherent frequency response, the result of system inertia, is the ability of an electrical machine to absorb and store or inject energy in order to manage frequency. One way to do this is to use technology with a rotating mass, like flywheels and synchronous condensers, to store energy for short-term frequency support. This helps to prevent blackouts, due to a rapid change of frequency and maintains a stable grid, within its frequency limits.  ",

The same generator also provides system inertia which is critical to maintaining a steady frequency in the grid. And no matter the source of generated power, electrical grid systems rely on both for grid security, safety, and reliability.",

Since power is produced on demand, it's critical to ensure that the power system frequency and voltage remain within normal ranges. Maintaining this balance is necessary to keep the power grid stable and efficient.",
            "To ensure the grid remains stable and secure, it is essential to balance the electricity grid through frequency stabilization, short circuit power, and voltage control. Flexibility stabilization happens when system inertia responds to sudden load imbalances. The inertia delays the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF), so downstream grid stability controls can be executed.",

            "Distribution transformers can be both the last step in the conversion chain that bring electrical energy to the consumer as well as the first transformation step to feed decentrally-generated power into the power grid. Distribution transformers by Siemens Energy are designed for superior reliability, efficiency and environmental performance. A modular architecture paired with design options ensure cost efficiency and easy minimal maintenance.",
            "The transformer’s core-and-coil assembly consists of the core, windings, and connecting cables. High-quality drying and quick filling with insulation oil play a key role in extending the transformer’s service life. Siemens Energy employs the latest techniques. For example, in vacuum low-frequency plants (LFH – low-frequency heating), the process of drying the solid insulation is combined with vacuum drying of the windings through low-frequency heating. The active part is heated by applying low-frequency current (< 1 Hz) to the high-voltage windings with the low-voltage windings short-circuited. While still in the plant, transformers are filled with preheated insulation liquid which is absorbed by the insulation material, thus preventing the intake of oxygen.",
            "The iron core forms the central element of every transformer. High-grade, cold-rolled – and, depending on requirements laser-treated – metal sheets are precision-cut using computer-controlled machines to ensure compliance with even the smallest tolerances. The individual sheets are then assembled into cores using the step-lap technique or, in the case of transformers with a lower power rating, using precise winding technology. In this way, Siemens Energy's fluid-immersed distribution transformers achieve an especially good flux distribution at the joints, resulting in exceptionally low losses and minimal no-load noise.",
            "Transformer windings are subject to extremely high electrical and mechanical stresses and must therefore be protected. The transformer windings of Siemens Energy distribution transformers are made of copper or aluminum. Low-voltage windings are made from strip or flat wire, and high-voltage windings are manufactured from round or profile wire. The use of insulating paper partially coated with epoxy resin (diamond-dotted paper) bonds the winding into a compact block during the drying process and additionally increases the short-circuit capacity.",
            "The layer insulation is adapted to the alternating voltage strain that occurs in daily operation. Large-scale oil channels are provided to ensure sufficient cooling of the windings and to avoid hot spots. All leads are short-circuit-proof and surge-proof, contributing to the high reliability of the Siemens Energy transformer – and to an above-average service life.",
            "Whether during transport or operation, the tank must remain sealed tight under mechanical stress and regardless of wind or weather. Corrosion protection is especially important. The surface is sandblasted and then multicoated. Upon request, hot-dip galvanization can provide even better protection.",
            "The distribution transformer’s tank must dissipate the entire heat loss. In hermetically sealed transformers, the corrugated walls absorb the changes in the insulation liquid’s volume. Alternatively, the transformer can be designed as an open system or fitted with an oil conservator that compensates for the additional volume.",
            "Some regions also use smooth-walled tanks and built-in radiators. Hermetically sealed units sometimes have an air or gas cushion to compensate for oil expansion. The sheet-steel lid is bolted – or, upon request, welded – to the tank. The steel thickness and the bracing are dimensioned to ensure that the lid withstands all necessary stress.",

            "The grid frequency is balanced to 50 Hz or 60 Hz by parity of power demand and generation. The frequency must be kept within specific limits, even in the event of an imbalance: for example, from a disturbance. After a fault, the frequency can only be stabilized by an inertial response from generator-turbine sets. The mechanical kinetic energy defines the frequency drop after disturbance until the operating reserve is activated after several seconds by the primary frequency reserve (PFR). Fewer rotating machines result in shrinking instantaneous reserves, which increases the risk of exceeding critical frequency levels. This may lead to load rejection or a blackout. Grid operators are forced to keep power plants in operation in order to preserve the instantaneous reserve or to optionally invest in additional primary reserve. Some source of fast frequency response (FFR) is urgently needed to cover the gap between inertial response and operating reserves.",

            "Worldwide, offshore wind farms are growing in number and size as global demand for renewable energy increases. Additionally, the subsidies for wind power are ending. To keep pace, reliable and cyber-secured control solutions are required to optimize operations and to manage the fleet of wind and other generating units over the complete lifecycle. Advancements in offshore wind generation controls enable operators to monitor and automate individual turbines and their communication networks. SCADA technology allows for these individual offshore wind turbine generators to be interconnected and viewed through a single platform. Tools and systems for direct marketing of wind power on the intraday, spot, and balancing energy market help wind farm operators remain competitive.  ",

With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating.

The Siemens Energy synchronous condenser solution comprises a horizontal synchronous generator connected to the high-voltage transmission network via a step-up transformer. It is started up and stopped with a frequency-controlled electric motor (pony motor) or a starting frequency converter. When the generator has reached operating synchronous speed, it will be synchronized with the transmission network, and the machine is operated as a motor providing reactive and short-circuit power to the transmission network.",
            "Contribution of short-circuit power",
            "After the generator is synchronized with the network it behaves like a synchronous motor with no load, providing short-circuit power to the transmission network.",
            "Voltage support",
            "The generator is connected to the transmission network through a transformer. Either a pony motor or a static frequency converter starts it and provides reactive power when it’s synchronous to the system frequency. ",

            "During emergencies or contingencies the synchronous condenser can provide a significantly higher rating for a short time, depending on its specifications.",

            "The generator provides the necessary inertia by means of its rotating mass while also providing or absorbing reactive power.",
            "Our synchronous condenser solutions use a generator to provide the necessary inertia with its rotating mass while also providing or absorbing reactive power. The generator is connected to the transmission network by a transformer, and is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once operating speed is achieved, the generator is synchronized with the network and behaves like a synchronous motor with no load, providing reactive power and shortcircuit power to the transmission network.",
            "To provide maximum inertia, Siemens Energy has extended the established synchronous condensers solution with additional rotating mass from a flywheel. This extension is a very effective method to maintain the required level of inertia and thus the RoCoF (Rate of change of frequency) of the system. Rotating mass provides an inherent synchronous inertia response (SIR), what is counteracting grid frequency fluctuations with active power injection or absorption during sudden load unbalance events.",
            "Siemens Energy’s flywheels are operated in partial vacuum to minimize air friction losses and reduce the cooling efforts to maintain required temperature level in all operational and emergency modes. The design enables a safe emergency run-down in case of total power loss (grid black-out). The flywheel is designed for plug & play installation delivered to the site with rotor installed, lowest possible footprint and low supervision and maintenance effort.",
            "One of our current projects - Rassau: turnkey solution synchronous condenser with Flywheel",
            "Synchronous condensers help to drive the decarbonization journey for power assets. With the rising adoption of renewable energy, traditional power generation methods are utilized less, and generators are being shut down. A Brownfield rotating grid stabilizer conversion not only enables a rising share of renewable infeed on the grid but also provides a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to a new build.",

That makes mechanically switched capacitors (MSC) and mechanically switched reactors (MSR) the most economical power compensation devices for mainly constant or predictable voltage. Both devices are connected to the grid via high-voltage circuit breakers. Under heavy load conditions, MSCs provide voltage control and grid stabilization in a simple and cost-efficient way. MSRs provide stability under low load conditions or can be used at the end of long, radial AC lines. However, usage is somewhat limited as the capacitors need to discharge for several minutes after switching off an MSC bank. Filter circuits are often used in industrial plants. The filter circuits damp the generated harmonics which are produced by inverters and nonlinear loads. The MSCDN additionally offers a damping network to avoid resonance conditions in the electrical system. ",

            "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. ",
            "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.",

It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2.",
            "Also in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV. ",

            "From its invention in 1948, Siemens Energy has perfected the design and manufacture of integrally geared compressors. Today, more than 2,200 units have been installed globally proving their worth with a wide reference base in a wide range of industries and applications such as air separation and CO2 compression.",
            "Integrally geared compressors are multi-shaft machines. Several pinion shafts with one or two impellers each are arranged around a central bull gear. For each pinion shaft a perfect combination of shaft speed and impeller size can be realized. All impellers are of overhung design and can be fitted with adjustable inlet guide vanes in front of each impeller. Inter-stage cooling of the gas stream can be done after each impeller discharge. The combination of these features allows for high volume flows, outstanding energy efficiency even under part load, all in a compact design.",
            "For small- to medium-size compressor sizes, Siemens Energy offers a package design. The package can include the compressor, driver, process gas coolers, lube oil console, process piping, and all tubing and wiring. The package design leads to significantly reduced on-site installation time. For large-size units all main train components are delivered separately to site to be installed on a concrete foundation.",
            "Geared for success - Exploring integrally geared compressors",
            "In this webinar series our experts discuss integrally geared compressors and their applications, providing you with a deeper understanding of this compression technology and the advancements shaping the industry.",
            "Our customized line of integrally geared machines can accommodate up to four pinion shafts with up to eight impellers total resulting in impressive pressure ratios which can be achieved in a compact design. Compressors can be designed according to API 617 or API 672 and customer specifications. Driver options depend on process and energy resources and can be electric motor, steam turbine or gas turbine and are suitable for direct turbine-drive or even integrated expansion turbine design.",
            "A variant of the customized integrally geared compressor allows the integration of a single- or two-stage radial expansion turbine as a direct drive option for the compressor. This allows the direct recovery and conversion of energy from pressurized high temperature process gas streams into kinetic energy driving the compressor. Depending on the amount of available energy, this drive option can serve as sole drive, or as drive in combination with other drive options such as electric motor or steam turbine.  ",
            "Our standardized designs come with up to two pinion shafts with one or two impellers each. Standardized integrally geared machines come in two groups of frame sizes for 10,000-100,000 and 120,000-400,000m3/h capacity. These product lines are standardized versions of the customized integrally geared compressor series, the trusty workhorse of the air separation and process industry. The high degree of standardization results in lower capital costs and shorter delivery times as compared with fully customized compressors.",
            "The first group is available in nine frames (sizes 10-100) for volume flow rates between 10,000 and 100,000m3/h and can be packaged as compact single-lift units. ",
            "The second group extends the available range of volume flow rates to between 120,000–400,000m3/h capacities with additional five frame sizes (165-400). Eighty percent of the machine is pre-engineered for consistency and repeatability. 20 percent of the machine can be customized for specific customer process needs. ",
            "Our single stage centrifugal compressor is the perfect fit for atmospheric air compression at low pressure ratios. It covers a large flow range from small to very high volumes of up to 1.000.000 m3/h. This compressor uses well proven components from our integral geared compressor line and is designed in accordance with API 617. State-of-the-art aerodynamic parts allow a compact, single stage design. If necessary, an external gear box is used to match the driver speed. This modular design offers the advantage of an unchanged compressor design irrespective whether the machine is driven by a steam turbine, gas turbine or electric motor.",
            "Our single stage overhung compressor boasts a simple and robust design with well referenced components, smaller dimensions and less weight at the highest efficiency level, and low maintenance requirements.",
            "In case of higher pressure ratio requirements, the configuration comprises two single stage overhung machines driven by a double-ended steam turbine drive between the compressors.",

            "Looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to recover waste heat in your industrial processes? For waste heat temperature levels from approximately 70°C (i.e. mid-temperature levels), MVR cycles provide an alternative to closed loop heat pumps for recovering waste heat, to produce low, medium, or high-pressure steam.",
            "MVR cycles use advanced compression technology to extract heat from industrial processes and convert it into usable energy. This technology is particularly useful for the downstream oil and gas, chemicals, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and aluminum industries, where waste heat is a byproduct of many processes.",
            "With MVR cycles, thermal energy from a mid-temperature waste stream is used to directly evaporate feedwater. The steam is then compressed to the required temperature and pressure level of the process. The entire latent heat for evaporation is provided by the free-of-charge waste heat. Only the sensible heat, which is significantly lower than the latent/evaporation heat, is provided in the form of compression. The steam can then be used for industrial purposes, either as a feedstock or as a heating medium, e.g. in the chemical industry or in pulp and paper.",
            "For application cases in which waste steam is present at lower than desired pressure levels, the steam can simply be compressed up to higher pressure and temperature levels, with the use of our multi-stage integrally geared steam compressors.",

            "The solution has four main components: gateway, historian, analytics and dashboard. The gateway can connect to several generations of control systems and third-party systems for collecting data. The historian will hold high resolution event-based plant data for the lifetime of the plant. Analytics will do condition-based monitoring of equipment and alarm/maintenance/production/safety-reporting. The dashboard features live trending, process pictures, dashboards, KPI displays, playback and much more. The solution can be used either as a local only solution or a cloud-based solution.",
            "Assets are a central part of the Omnivise for Offshore solution. An asset can be a pump, motor, valve and other field equipment, but also switches, routers and IT equipment. Asset templates contains both the condition/performance monitoring to be performed in by analytics framework and the layout of the equipment in the Omnivise for Offshore dashboard. The results of each condition monitored will be output to a time series tag value. There will also be written a health state for each condition, indicating normal, warning or alert. These values can be visualized in customer dashboard as traffic lights or charts. The template is typically created once and then it’s quick to configure multiple instances. In Omnivise for Offshore dashboard each equipment will have its own homepage.",
            "Predictive Maintenance is an important function to reduce the maintenance effort and to move the maintenance planning to the onshore organization. The main SOGO philosophy is to push data upwards in the hierarchy and store the data in a Historian or Cloud system.  SOGO Analytics runs on top of the Historian and thus has all data sources available (such as ICSS data, vibration data, IoT, engineering data ++).",
            "All data collecting from the PCS 7 controllers are event based. This means that data is updated on change and not pulled/polled at an interval from the controllers. At the end of each logic sequence, the controllers will send a snapshot of a selection of values to the gateway if the value is changed outside the dead band configured in the controllers. This has several benefits like high resolution data when it matters: like monitoring of critical temperatures on equipment. Values that are rarely changed don’t have to store duplicate values that have to be cleansed in the historian at a later stage. The network traffic is also kept at a bare minimum since only update values are sent. The PLC is pushing the data, so there is no need for a lot of computing power doing polling of all tags on the gateway. ",
