        "More than ever, the process industries are on mission to leverage their investments to increase production efficiency, maximize return on assets, and deliver value throughout project lifecycle.  Whether you need engineering and advisory services for process design, process decarbonization, process safety and risk management, or asset integrity and reliability projects, our team of industrial process consultants and engineering experts are here to tackle most vital challenges.  We do this by combining diverse engineering talent, project insights, and innovative solutions.  We enable our customers to make effective decisions, fulfill operational objectives with customer-specific economic and technical boundary conditions, enhanced assets reliability, and improve facility position to better meet personnel, asset, and environment safety goals. ",
        "Process industries contribute 1/3rd of total CO2 emissions and have ambitious reduction targets by 2030 and net zero by 2050.  Success in achieving these targets is dependent on defining a holistic strategy and step-by-step decarbonization roadmap.  Our decarbonization consulting experts support our customers defining and driving their path towards net zero.",
        "An effective asset reliability and asset integrity management offers opportunities for facilities to minimize equipment failure, costly downtime, while adhering to environmental and regulatory requirements.  Our asset reliability and asset integrity management experts supported by our software technology help our customers maintain their assets in a fit-for-service, while extending life in the most reliable, safe, and cost-effective manner possible.",
        "By combining diverse engineering talent, project insights, flexible execution, and innovative solutions we enable our customers to achieve project success.  The early project engagements for concept and feasibility studies, basic engineering, FEED, design verification, and utilization of software technology has helped our customers maximizing projects’ ROI.",
        "Keeping people, assets, and environment safe is a fundamental requirement in process industry and is a license to operate.  We support our customers in their journey to excellence in process safety with our expertise in process hazards identification, analysis, and risk assessments.  Gaining visibility into facility’s risk position enables critical operational and project decisions, while ensuring compliance with standards and regulations.",
        "Process operators are continuously making decisive action to safely achieve maximize operational throughput.  No matter how complex your flare and pressure relief systems questions, we have the experience, capabilities, and software technology to help optimize, analyze safety compliance, and document the pressure relief systems data while achieving flaring reduction and operation objectives.",
        "Industries are on the edge of a new trend in asset reliability and efficiency improvement.  The common challenge is to maintain production capability cost-effectively while preserving the asset integrity.  Digitalization of asset integrity management that supports risk-based decision enables reduction in operational uncertainty to achieve cost savings, safety improvement, and productivity.",
        "An effective process safety management is essential for the industry transition into renewable energy.  The hydrogen, e-fuels, and biofuel processing facilities are required to implement a robust process safety and asset integrity management framework across the production, transportation, and storage value chain.  We support our customers in their needs with process design engineering, process safety and asset integrity management.",
        "As the process industry evolves toward greater reliance on and integration with information technology, it is critical to consider malicious and intentional disruption of process operations that may exploit the enhanced capabilities and integration of modern communication with process safety, controls, and operations.",
