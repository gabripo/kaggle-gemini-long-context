        "Efficient, reliable, and cost-effective solution to mitigate noise and losses on power transformers caused by DC-current",
        "In transformer operations, ground potential differences of typically less than a few 10 Volts cause parasitic DC currents. These currents can cause an increase in transformer noise and no-load losses.\n",
        "By mitigating parasitic currents passing through the transformer's neutral, these effects can be minimized.\n",
        "Hitachi Energy introduces the DC Mitigator - an innovative and effective solution that can efficiently suppress such DC currents and improve the grid’s quality.\n",
        "DC Mitigator by Hitachi Energy is a unique solution with only passive components built in. It is unlike any other similar solution available.\n",
        "The modular design of DC Mitigator makes it flexible and adaptable to match the on-site condition of the power transformer. Weatherproof solutions for DC Mitigator are offered as a standard option for this application.\n",
        "Hitachi Energy can also offer on-site evaluation and measurements to provide the best-fit solution.\r\n ",
