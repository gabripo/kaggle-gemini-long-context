        "Industrial heat pumps are an efficient and cost-effective solution for the generation of heat and cold. They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do.",
        "As one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours. ",
        "During the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat. ",

        "Heat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one.",
        "Siemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids. The refrigerants have negligible environmental impact in all aspects:",
        "As responsible manufacturers, we see refrigerants as a design element of a heat pumps system. We will use the optimum refrigerant for the specific solution.",
        "Decarbonizing heat: The hot topic we can't ignore",
        "Heat accounts for around half of global energy consumption, contributing 40% of CO2 emissions. On the way to carbon neutrality, we thus can no longer ignore the topic. In an excellent article Christian Hüttl and Norbert Wenn outline the tools to green heat - at home, in buildings and in industry.",
        "Making the most of waste heat",
        "Before the end of 2022, at Potsdamer Platz in the German capital Berlin, a novel hightemperature industrial heat pump will start supplying the city’s district heating system with net-zero heat. This is a pioneering project on the way to decarbonizing heat.",
        "German utility deploys river heat pump to decarbonize heating",
        "Siemens Energy is supplying a large-scale river heat pump to Mannheim-based utility MVV in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The heat pump will use Rhine water as a heat source and, according to Siemens Energy, will be one of the largest heat pumps in Germany.",
