All industries are affected either through the goods they produce or their internal infrastructures. Nowhere is this more important than in the critical sustainable energy sector, which is quickly becoming the energy source of the future, meaning operational assurances need to be guaranteed. As an industry leader and your business partner in electrical transmission, Hitachi Energy understands this and has developed programs and services to assist business partners with this concern.",
        "Complex and confusing standards coupled with unique and diverse technologies create difficulties for transmission operators. To help customers with some of these cyber related burdens, Hitachi Energy has developed a number of services to assist with identifying and updating systems to reduce cyber attack surfaces and support compliance regulations.",
