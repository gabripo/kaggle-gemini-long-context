        "Safety and reliability are essential to the operation of power transformers. For the past 60 years, oil-filled, paper-insulated condenser bushings have been applied to power transformers. While they have faithfully served their purpose, ensuring these bushings' safe and reliable operation can be time-consuming and costly. Typical concerns voiced by users include damage or outage due to vandalism or attack, porcelain shards damaging equipment or injuring people, catastrophic fire, oil leaks, and flashover due to contamination.​",
        "The ANSI/IEEE market solution is the O Plus Dry™ bushing. Hitachi Energy's O Plus Dry bushing meets or exceeds IEEE standards. It uses no paper and no porcelain and contains no oil. It is less fragile than porcelain bushings and lighter in weight. It uses HTV silicone rubber weather sheds, which are hydrophobic and self-cleaning even in highly polluted environments.​\r\n ",
