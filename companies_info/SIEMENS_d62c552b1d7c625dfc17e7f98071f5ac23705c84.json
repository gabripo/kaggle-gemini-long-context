        "Line surge arresters (LSA) are designed to prevent ground faults and short circuits in power lines caused by lightning or switching overvoltages. Insulator flashovers, voltage dips and interruptions are prevented by eliminating all lightning and switching overvoltages above the insulator insulation level (the lightning-impulse withstand level, or LIWL for short).",
        "Installation of line surge arresters at recommended locations along the line in accordance with our line simulation ensures anhanced overvoltage protection. Selecting the optimum line surge arresters, especially in terms of their quantity and installation locations, significantly improves the reliability of the overall line system and the quality of power that it supplies. We offer line surge arresters for system voltages up to 800 kV and an energy discharge capability of 3.6 C.",
        " Benefits:",
        "In case of lightning, the spark gap flashes over and the arrester limits the ground fault current from several kA to a few amperes, and extinguishes the arc within 10 ms such that no circuit breaker operation at both line ends is needed, i.e. no reclosing operation.",
        "Benefits:",
        "Siemens Energy optionally offers software analysis (simulation) based on Cigré studies to examine and conduct preliminary tests of customer-specific applications as a way of determining the optimal, cost-effective solution. With this approach, the customer only needs to equip particular phases or individual line segments with line surge arresters, and can still ensure sufficient lightning protection of the overhead line.",
        "In the first phase of an analysis, all important parameters of the transmission line under study are entered into the simulation software, and the installations to be examined are selected. This approach takes the following factors into consideration:",
