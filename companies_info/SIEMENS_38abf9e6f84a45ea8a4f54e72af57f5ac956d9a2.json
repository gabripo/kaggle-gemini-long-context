        "In October 2023, we have received the TÜV SÜD certificate for the hydrogen readiness concept covering combined cycle plants, simple cycle plants and combined heat and power plants equipped with the SGT-9000HL. With this certificate, TÜV SÜD validates the readiness concept for main systems and components with exception of the gas turbine package for hydrogen readiness up to 100% hydrogen. The gas turbine package itself is rated as H2 ready for up to 50%Vol, based on current rig test results.",
        "This is an important milestone in the 9000HL’s hydrogen journey as TÜV SÜD is an internationally recognized certifier, and this certificate is evidence that we meet the requirements to offer hydrogen-ready power plants in line with regulatory requirements, customer expectations and transformation roadmaps. We are aiming to have all gas turbines capable of burning 100% hydrogen by 2030, to help our customers meet their demands of the energy transition.  ",
        "Complementing the HL gas turbine, our innovative GT Auxiliary Integrated Package (AIP) provides you with smart, streamlined construction and servicing.  ",
