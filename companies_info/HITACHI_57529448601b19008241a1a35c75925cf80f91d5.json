        "With EconiQ™ Implementation services, Hitachi Energy has created a tailored program that helps our customers analyze the environmental impact of power grid maintenance and project activities, defining concrete actions to reduce it, and compensate for the remaining emissions.\n\n The activities we execute during our power systems lifecycle are essential to secure their reliability. Working together with our customers to better understand the environmental impact of these activities is a key pillar of our offering. \n While life cycle assessments (LCAs) introduce a product-oriented vision of the environmental impact that normally leaves the impact of maintenance activities and projects out of scope. They are far from negligible for our customers’ overall environmental footprint. Every small contribution matters. \n",
        "Our EconiQ™ Implementation services provide a detailed mapping of all your service and project activities’ CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing your awareness and optimizing execution to reduce or even avoid your impact, as well as compensating the remaining footprint.",
        "Environmental Sustainability\r\nImplementing strategies to reduce your carbon footprint to foresee a greener future, mitigating current environmental harm of your maintenance activities and fostering a sustainable tomorrow.\n\nReliability\r\nEnhancing energy security and securing reliability is one of our core values. Our offering includes solutions to allow our customers to boost their system reliability, addressing current and future system supply challenges.",
        "Affordability\nEnabling access to affordable and equitable energy through cost-effective solutions and innovative technologies, accelerating electrification, renewable integration, energy efficiency, among others.",
        "Measure and evaluate your carbon footprint. Increase the awareness of your environmental footprint through a comprehensive assessment and report.",
        "\nUnderstand your activities and their impact\nWe are committed to minimizing your environmental impact and specifically the impact of the actions we provide to you with our services, from the definition to the execution of the works.",
        "\nIdentify emission hotspots through the environmental report generated\nWith the calculations made, Hitachi Energy will generate a report containing all the details of your project and the environmental impact associated with it by category, such as equipment, construction, shipping, and traveling, among others. This report will identify the emission hotspots of your services activities.\n\nDefine data-driven greener strategies\nHaving access to this data and the possibility of comparing various scenarios will allow you to define more efficient, data-driven strategies for carbon footprint improvement.",
        "Once the impact of all activities has been analyzed, our experts can suggest alternatives on how to implement more sustainable maintenance activities to your power system by wisely choosing products and actions having lower environmental impact.",
        "More sustainable products and materials\nWhen designing a maintenance activity, spare parts and replacement of core products have a strong impact on the overall environmental footprint. In this context, our EconiQ™ product portfolio offers you more environmentally friendly assets (SF6-free high-voltage products, transformers with less pollutant oils, etc.). Avoiding a 100g SF6-leakage is equivalent to eliminating 2 tCO2 equivalent emissions.",
        "Preventing unnecessary activities\nPreventing unnecessary activities is one of the pillars of an efficient and sustainable maintenance strategy. After carefully considering whether a maintenance activity of a particular asset is even necessary, the next step is to think about how you can reduce the frequency of that task or if you can perform it more efficiently. This will lead to cutting the environmental impact of existing and future maintenance activities. For example, our analysis show that eliminating a small avoidable maintenance activity can result in approximately 0.5 – 1 tCO2 equivalent emission reduction.",
        "Execute with a smaller footprint\nBuilding on our domain expertise in the field and our large installed base, together we will evaluate the alternatives to execute site activities tasks more efficiently. To do so, we will examine using smart shipping strategies, finding alternatives to on-site interventions, and using digital technologies as much as possible to optimize maintenance strategies. Our analysis show that for short maintenance activities, traveling is sometimes the major contributor to the carbon footprint. Every time we avoid a flight from America to Europe using augmented reality support, we are saving more than 0.5 tCO2 equivalent emissions.",
        "Hitachi Energy offers carbon neutral and net-zero services, by adding compensation solutions to previous quantification and reduction strategies. Thanks to our key collaborations, we can now capture the CO2 emitted.",
        "CO2 offset\r\nOffset strategies create a compensation of the same amount of carbon emissions due to a specific service or activity. Carbon offsets are achieved by actions such as promoting renewable sources for energy development or tree-planting programs that balance the environmental impact of services provided.",
        "CO2 capture\nCapture strategies seek to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. This is achieved by capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. An effective and reliable way to make a real impact and achieve negative emissions.",
        "Hitachi Energy offers cutting-edge sustainability services to calculate, cut and compensate for your environmental impact.",
