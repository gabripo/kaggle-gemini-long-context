        "The Siemens Energy SGT-400 is a durable twin-shaft gas turbine suitable for power generation and mechanical drive applications in the 10 – 15 MW power band, suitable for all climates, onshore and offshore. ",
        "It boasts operational and fuel flexibility, low emissions, and overall efficiency, with enhancements to rotors and blades as well as a 33% increase in time between overhauls. ",
        "Its can-annular design with single-stage combustion enables it to burn a wide range of fuel compositions efficiently at all loads, meeting stringent emissions standards even at low loads, and offering seamless true dual-fuel capability.",
        "*Service intervals can be extended based on operating profile.   ",
        "A large team of cross-trained field service technicians and engineers, 24/7 help desks and remote monitoring make the SGT-400 easy to own and operate over its entire lifecycle.",
        "Can burn many fuel types and qualities, including liquid fuels and gases with high inerts, thanks to controls technology. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 30 vol% of hydrogen (H2). Equipped with diffusion burners with unabated NOx emissions, it can burn up to 65 vol% of hydrogen (H2). Remains on Stable load during fuel changeovers.",
        "Able to operate efficienctly across a wide load and speed range – from 10 to 15 MW.",
        "Wide load and temperature range for ultra low emissions.",
        "Compact dimensions, on-site or off-site maintainability, and high reliability. Can be used as direct drive for compressors or pumps, or for power generation. Onshore use in oil fields or refinery applications and offshore on platforms and FPSO vessels",
        "Best in class efficiency in simple cycle or combined cycle applications and combined heat and power (CHP) uses.",
        "Cut section of the SGT-400 core engine",
        "SGT-400 core engine",
        "The SGT-400 package for power generation is suited for simple cycle, combined cycle and cogeneration. Its high steam-raising capability, compact arrangement, robustness and reliability, and ease of maintenance make it an ideal choice for many applications.",
        "The mechanical drive package is very compact, providing a small footprint and a high power-to-weight ratio.",
        "Its size and power make the SGT-400 an ideal offshore and onshore gas turbine. For example, it can be used for:",
        "Siemens Energy delivered two SGT-400 power generation units to power the water injection system on the FPSO vessel “Cidade de Itajai,” which operates at the Tiro and Sidon fields in the southern part of the Santos Basin off the coast of Brazil.",
        "Our specialists provide local, on-site support and remote monitoring to optimize the turbine’s performance and keep lifecycle costs low. ",
        "Our comprehensive portfolio of services include long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul service, field service, spare parts, service exchange, remote diagnostic service, and modernization and upgrades. Core engine maintenance can be performed on-site or off-site.",
        "SGT-400 maintenance features:",
        "First-stage rotor blades can be axially removed for quick and easy on-site exchange, maximizing availability.",
        "Burner modules can be easily accessed for maintenance, minimizing downtime and maximizing availability.",
        "Multiple borescope holes allow visual inspection of the engine’s interior without disassembly. Borescope inspections prevent unnecessary outages.",
        "The SGT-400 can burn a wide range of gases, including non-pipeline quality gaseous fuels and distillate liquid fuels, covering a Wobbe fuel range from approximately 50 MJ/m3 to 17.5 MJ/m3. ",
        "This includes fuels available in LNG liquefaction plants, wellhead gas, minimally processed weak wellhead gas, coke oven gas, biogas from ethanol industry waste, or landfill gas.",
        "The engine has a hydrogen (H2) capability of up to 30 vol% with DLE burners or up to 65% with diffusion burners with unabated NOx emissions. Additionally, it offers true dual-fuel DLE capability with automatic changeover from primary to secondary fuel at any load.",
        "To provide high fuel flexibility, the SGT-400 uses a robust can-annular combustion system with six reverse-flow tubular chambers and a high energy igniter in each combustor.",
        "The SGT-400’s DLE combustor burns a great variety of gaseous and liquid fuels and features clean combustion with low emissions.",
        "The field-proven DLE combustor provides clean combustion with low emissions across a wide operating range in the SGT-400. ",
        "It utilizes six reverse-flow tubular combustion chambers around a high-pressure casing, each capable of gas-only, liquid-only, or dual-fuel operation. The control system ensures smooth, automatic changeover of fuel across the power range. ",
        "The DLE combustion system enables the turbine to comply with emission regulations even at lower operation loads down to 30%, with NOx emissions of ≤ 15 ppmvd (corrected to 15% O2 dry).",
        "The SGT-400 DLE combustion system meets the most stringent NOx and CO emissions legislation.",
        "Since NOx emission increases exponentially with rising temperature, it is crucial to ensure that air and fuel are well mixed. The Siemens DLE combustion system uses a lean air-fuel premix with multiple fuel injection points to achieve low emissions over a wide load range.",
