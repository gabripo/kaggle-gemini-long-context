        "In-situ condition analysis of your 2-pole generators - without rotor removal",
        "Generators are usually in use for many years. During operation, aging and grid effects may lead to severe damages on vital components such as rotor or stator.",
        "Prolonged outages due to unpredicted repairs can be avoided with our advanced robotic in-situ inspection and condition analysis.",
        "Due to the small air gap dimensions of (industrial) generators, it is recommended to disassemble the rotor at regular intervals for a thorough and professional inspection of all main components.",
        "Depending on the complexity of the installation situation and the operating application of the generator, this disassembly is often associated with a high level of installation work and thus a long system downtime. Unforeseen maintenance or repair measures therefore can extend the downtime in an unplanned way.\n",
        "By performing a robotic inspection prior to the scheduled major overhaul of the generator, we offer a comprehensive, combined inspection program consisting of visual findings and proven electrical diagnostic measurements that allow our experienced experts to make a valid assessment of the condition of your generator. ",
        "The results of the robot inspection serve as a solid basis to evaluate the generator condition.",

Our portfolio ranges from monitoring products to predictive maintenance and long-term service agreements to reduce your effort and increase the reliability of your generator assets.  ",

        "This recently developed engineering approach combines the cutting edge in generator technology with the interfaces of legacy generator types while ideally catering to the operator's economic interests. The focus is on integrating state-of-the-art active parts as used in today's newly built units to engineer tailored replacement machines that will take over from the original machines within a foreseeable time frame.",
        "The replacement machines are designed to mate with all relevant interfaces (i.e. shaft centerline height, foundations, etc.) of the legacy unit and to facilitate quick exchange.",
        "The footprint approach can be applied to nearly all generators, irrespective of the model and type of cooling, and for all conventional designs on the 50-Hz and 60-Hz markets, for voltages of 6.3 kV, 10.5 kV or 13.0 kV.\n",
        "The increasing cost and delivery times for replacement parts and servicing the generator's original excitation systems are economic incentives for upgrading. Replacing the original analog excitation systems with wear-free, state-of-the-art digital systems not only reduces running costs but also improves unit availability.",
