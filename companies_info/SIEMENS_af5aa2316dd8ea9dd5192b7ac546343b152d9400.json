        "Siemens Energy offers Bronze, Silver, and Gold services for security patch management, providing a comprehensive solution. Leveraging its expertise as an original equipment manufacturer, we offer customized patch management tailored to our customers' specific HVDC/FACTS systems and software.  With a team of highly experienced cyber security experts and direct access to vendors and information sources, Siemens Energy ensures optimal system protection from cyber threats.",
        "The Bronze version includes monthly newsletters on available security patches relevant to customers' systems. They inform users about the impact and criticality of vulnerabilities and possible solutions.",
        "Additional Web links to vendor's Web pages for security patch downloads are also provided. The Bronze service provides valuable information to keep the customer up-to-date and aware about cyber threats but without pre-testing.",
        "The advanced Silver version includes testing security patches on a Siemens Energy generic testbed and, if available, on the customer's maintenance and training simulator (MTS). The generic testbed is a Siemens Energy facility designed for HVDC/FACTS systems for testing purposes, but it may not cover the full configuration of all customer operational systems. If testing on the testbed is not feasible, alternative mitigation measures will be evaluated. Additionally, if the customer has an MTS, further testing will be conducted on it as part of the Silver service, providing close-to-operational system testing scope and results.",
        "The highest-level Gold version comprises the installation of tested security patches on the site of the operational system during scheduled yearly outages on a regular basis. This includes preparation, secure backup, patch installation, basic testing, and documentation.",
        "To protect critical infrastructure, many governments around the world are imposing increasingly stringent cybersecurity regulations on transmission system operators.",
        "Standardized cybersecurity certifications will help our customers to demonstrate the cybersecurity of their assets to regulators, insurers, investors and the public and simplifies proof of compliance with the respective regulatory requirements.",
        "Siemens Energy is the only major supplier in the field of HVDC and FACTS solutions holding the IEC 62443 2-4 and 3-3 certificate for our reference architecture.",
        "IEC 62443 is the leading international standard for the IT security for industrial communication networks. It provides a holistic security framework for Industrial Automation & Control Systems (IACS).",
