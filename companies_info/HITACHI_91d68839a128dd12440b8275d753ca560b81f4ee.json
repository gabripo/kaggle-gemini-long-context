        "\nBased on many years of experience in complex installations, Hitachi Energy offers services to evolve or upgrade the installation to the next generation, extend system lifetime, and improve availability and reliability.",
        "Upgrades\nProactively upgrading a system before a severe outage occurs can save time and money. The need for upgrading depends mainly on age, the general condition of the equipment, and the potential unavailability of spare parts.",
        "Modernizing an HVDC installation has been shown to extend system lifetime, improve availability and reliability, increase cost efficiency, improve performance, increase the capacity, and increase the power rating of the link.\n",
        "HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations.",
        "HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used.",
        "Electricity is converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa in a converter station. This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves.",
        "Hitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world.",
        "The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.",
