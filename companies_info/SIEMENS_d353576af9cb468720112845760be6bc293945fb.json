        "At Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a close alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, co-creating the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. We have fostered this collaborative, interactive approach from the earliest days of the Blue portfolio.",
        "For example, back in 2018 we joined forces with Iljin Electric to produce the first SF6-free 170 kV GIS with vacuum technology. And it's an approach we have found to be mutually beneficial in every case since. Innovation is boosted on both sides, costs are shared and the optimal solution is reached more quickly.",
        "The EU has launched a multi-million euro project to reduce greenhouse gases across the entire energy chain – in particular, SF6 gas. Read how we’re working together with eleven other partners from nine countries to achieve this.",
        "Together with five other leading power equipment manufacturers, we have formed the Switching Gears for Net Zero Alliance. To prevent harm to the environment and to human health, we are campaigning for:",
        "Siemens Energy has signed a formal agreement with Mitsubishi Electric to work closely together on the development of high-voltage switchgear with zero GWF. Methods for scaling up the application of clean air insulation technology to higher voltage are being researched, with a 245 kV dead tank circuit breaker being the first joint project. This collaboration will speed up the availability of cleaner solutions for customers around the world.",
        "Together with other leading electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) manufacturers, we have signed a joint commitment to deliver equipment free of F-gases and PFAS-gases. In conjunction with the increasing use of renewable energy sources, we will make truly sustainable, climate-neutral power grids a reality and facilitate the transition to net zero emission economies.",
        "TransnetBW award winners from left to right: Dr. Ulf Katschinski and Markus Klinner from Siemens Energy",
        "Siemens Energy is the winner of this years TransnetBW supplier award in the category sustainability.",
        "We would like to say „Thank you!\" to our customers, who put so much trust into our sustainable products, with Zero compromise in environmental protection and performance.",
        "We were delighted to bring together valued customers from the US at our Berlin factory to demonstrate the latest developments in our Blue portfolio - in particular, our Blue Dead Tank with clean air insulation.",
        "The factory is now 100% powered by renewable energy, providing our customers with the reassurance that we are making the whole supply chain as clean and sustainable as possible.",
        "To decarbonize the energy industry, it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating climate-hostile SF6 gas from electrical switchgear as soon as possible.",
        "Our Blue portfolio, based on clean air and vacuum switching technology, provides a viable, reliable and already available alternative. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment. Find out more about the future-ready Blue portfolio.",
