The purpose of this plan is to define the recommended preventive maintenance activities that can be foreseen, and to estimate the manpower requirements for these activities. It includes detailed maintenance instructions for each piece of equipment. It typically contains information such as item designation, maintenance activity, needed time interval, and required manhours and qualifications of the personnel.",
