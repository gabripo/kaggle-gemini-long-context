        "Our goal is to minimize your ongoing wet oil seal costs, unscheduled downtime and resulting productivity losses. Currently, there are thousands of centrifugal compressors installed globally that predate advanced Dry Gas Seal (DGS) technology and run with wet oil seals, which require costly maintenance and cause parasitic power losses due to oil shear and drag. ",
        "The Dry Gas Seals employed in our centrifugal compressors represent a significant advance in shaft sealing. This state-of-the-art solution will help by eliminating the ongoing maintenance costs associated with wet oil seals and thereby greatly increases equipment reliability and efficiency. The design of the Dry Gas Seal ensures best overall compressor performance as well as emission reduction for increased sustainability.  ",
        "The heart of the DGS is a pair of rings. A stationary ring is held against a rotating ring by spring pressure. The contact face of the rotating ring incorporates special fil-riding geometries in the form of groves or tapered lands on the outer portion.",
        "DGS designs:",
        "Siemens Energy, as the compressor OEM, is best suited to provide a sealing solution that ensures the best overall compressor performance and maintenance, from a single source. Applicable to all OEM and non-OEM centrifugal compressors.",
        "Dry gas seal retrofits, recompression help legacy compressors comply with current, future regulations.",
        "Our innovative sealing solution eliminates the need for a seal gas booster, protects dry gas seals from contamination, reduces maintenance and downtime costs.\nSeal Protect sits between the dry gas seal and process side seal, remaining open during operation to prevent contamination. In static or low-speed conditions, it ensures only clean, dry process gas reaches the Dry Gas Seal.\n \nBenefits of Seal Protect include:\nIncreased reliability: Our simplified design reduces component failure risk.Reduced cost: With lower operational and maintenance costs.Minimized footprint: Our system can replace the seal gas booster, saving space.Lower emissions: Seal Protect uses less power, reducing emissions.\nSeal Protect is compatible with most new compressor packages and can be retrofitted into existing units for improved reliability. \n \n \n",
