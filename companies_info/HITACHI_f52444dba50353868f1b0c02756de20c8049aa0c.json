        "PCS 6000 STATCOM is an efficient power system package specifically designed to be connected to demanding networks. The flexibility of the system allows it to be applied to a wide range of applications such as dynamic voltage stabilization, voltage balancing of asymmetrical loads, mitigating voltage flicker created by electric arc furnaces, and active harmonic filtering.",
        "The PCS 6000 STATCOM is particularly competitive in terms of installation time and space requirements. Furthermore, the high efficiency and low maintenance lead to low operational costs. The PCS 6000 provides outstanding performance for both steady state and dynamic operation as a pure static device with no switched passive elements.\n",
        "The PCS 6000 STATCOM solution is virtually maintenance free, due to the minimized number of moving mechanical parts. Outages for inspection can therefore be scheduled according to the customer’s needs and preferences. No rotating parts in the energy path result in extremely high reliability, availability and low operational costs combined with long life expectancy. The equipment is typically installed in a pre-assembled container. The STATCOM system including controls, power electronics and cooling unit are tailor made for fulfilling the customer specific requirements.",
        "Hitachi Energy’s STATCOM solutions based on PCS 6000 stands for high technical performance and economic operation. PCS 6000 enables customers to maximize operational efficiency and asset utilization, high reliability and profitability, increases network stability and enhances power quality. The flexibility of the PCS 6000 allows to be used in a wide range of markets, like renewables, railways, industrials and utilities. \n",
        "Typical areas of applications with PCS 6000 are:",
        "The PCS 6000 STATCOM uses advanced IGCT technology (Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor) that has been developed by Hitachi Energy from a proven bipolar semiconductor background. The PCS 6000 converters are based upon a standard IGCT PEBB, which allows systems to be realized with lower engineering and design costs. The innovative connection configuration allows for very good harmonic performance with typically no need for a harmonic filter.",
        "Hitachi Energy has ensured that the design concept of the modular container system reduces on site construction time to a minimum. The converter equipment is pre-assembled and tested to the highest standards and is shipped to site as a container package ready for immediate installation. Thanks to the high degree of standardization, the defined interfaces on site commissioning work can be reduced to a minimum. Due to the modular design, the system can even be relocated to a new site within a short time.",
