        "DRY NC® is a non-condenser, non-graded dry bushing, enabling the customer to benefit from the advantages of silicone rubber insulators by eliminating brittle porcelain and oil explosion risks. Firstly, an organic insulation resin layer is directly molded on the conductor rod. Afterward, the silicone rubber insulator is molded on top to create the final shed profile. In contrast with porcelain bushings, the DRY NC® installation is effortless and performed using a single flange capable of managing EN and DIN standards.​\r\n ",
