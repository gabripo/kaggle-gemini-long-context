        "We focus on compressor upgrades that provide mechanical and performance improvements. We understand this requires a considerable amount of engineering to define and execute on the solution. Whether it be total revamps of your compression system, improvements in dry gas seals, lube oil systems, rotors, or footprints, we deliver state-of-the-art designs that help you optimize your production facilities.  ",
        "Reducing maintenance costs, extending maintenance intervals through fewer leaks, improving reliability with the right valves, and lowering your emissions are a few examples of how we can make a big impact to your performance. ",
        "Compressor modernization services can enhance your efficiency ",
        "Compressor upgrades that can make a difference to your reliability ",
        "Work with us, the global technology leader and service provider, and we’ll keep your compression equipment updated with the latest modernizations and upgrades. ",
        "Upgrade your existing steam or gas turbine compression train with electric motors. By replacing mechanical drivers with electric motors, significant reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved. \n \nWe have the expertise to offer you the most optimized configuration to match your current or future processes.  Typically, this includes inspection of your existing motor, gear box, couplings, control panel, lube oil unit, overall train control, and the electrical grid, for a complete and thorough examination of your compression train.\n \nWhen your compression equipment begins to age, an upgrade to a modern compressor provides greater efficiencies, reliability, and maintainability and an optimized carbon footprint.\n \nAnd once your new compressor or electric motor is up and running, our dedicated field service teams are available to maintain your compression trains and ensure your operations are running smoothly. If needed this will include remote diagnostic services to monitor critical parameters and potential predictive maintenance to increase the lifetime of your compressor.  \n \nMake the switch to a more sustainable future with Siemens Energy. Contact us today to learn more about our experience to help you on your journey.",
