        "The three main factors which can affect the health of the transformers are paper, which is used for conductor insulation; the pressboard, which is used for the major insulation and winding support; and the insulating oil.",
        "With age, water and contaminants (air or gas bubbles, particles of different origins, oxygen, and oil aging) dissolve in the dielectric fluid of the transformer, increasing the risk of failures or accelerating aging of the insulation system, thus reducing the technical life. The level of possible contamination of the insulating oil over the years depends on its design, especially on the effectiveness of the oil preservation system and sources of contamination.\n",
        "By sampling and analyzing the dielectric fluid, contaminants can be detected, and appropriate preventative actions initiated. The Oil and Gas Analysis remains a critical component of the condition assessment of the transformer.",
        "Using our global reach, we support many customers worldwide in the collection of oil samples, the oil and gas analysis in our certified oil laboratories, as well as providing a first analysis of the unit's health status. Combining this with our extensive design knowledge as well as repair/refurbishment know-how accumulated over the years, we can present a more comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations to prolong the usage of the transformer.",
        "Online oil regeneration has technical and economic advantages when applied to old transformers with aged, acidic oil. The process is more environmentally friendly than oil replacement and demonstrates much better efficiency over the long term. This is a very efficient alternative to passivation since it enables the definitive removal of corrosive compounds from corrosive oils, thus avoiding the risk of copper sulfide formation.",
