        "With complete power collection and grid connection solutions, the Grid-eXpand™ Offshore is a systematic approach for the main electrical installation for power transmission on offshore platforms. It uses Hitachi Energy’s unrivaled domain expertise to deliver solutions, execute projects and develop groundbreaking technologies that enable renewable integration, high power quality and reliable and resilient power grids.
