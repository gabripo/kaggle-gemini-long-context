        "In order to help owners and operators successfully address ever growing market and economic challenges, they must also be efficient and effective. That’s the underlying premise of our marine solutions approach: continuously finding and developing innovations aimed at keeping your business operating and competing successfully and sustainably. We offer solutions for power, drive and automation technology – for almost every kind of vessel.",
        "SISHIP EcoMAIN assists you with ship management decisions by providing operating data from all relevant onboard systems and equipment on a joint data platform.",
        "As a monitoring system, IMAC provides clear visualization and seamless monitoring of a large number of fully automated processes running in parallel on ships of all types and sizes.",
        "OBTS and LBTS provide training in operational situations under realistic conditions on the actual automation software – either as onboard training (OBTS), or as land-based training (LBTS).",
        "Our engineering, monitoring, and control system EMCS has been developed to ensure efficient and safe operation of all vital subsystems of submarines.",
        "IPMS, Siemens Energy’s integrated automation system for naval surface vessels, features redundant monitoring and control of the propulsion system and other onboard subsystems.",
        "Our two diesel-electric marine propulsion systems reduce fuel requirements, increase maneuverability, minimize environmental risks, and make your ship quieter and more comfortable.",
        "Designed without compromising power output and fail-safe performance, our DRIVE MV integrated drive system offers an almost unlimited power range.",
        "In the Permasyn motor for submarines, excitation is achieved with permanent magnets. This results in outstanding features in terms of uncompromising reliability and operational readiness.",
        "Siemens Energy developed the SGM shaft generator with motor function in response to rising fuel costs and ever-stricter environmental regulations.",
        "With their outstanding reliability, minimized noise signature and stray field development, Siemens Energy DC-Prop DC drives are perfectly suitable for operation in submarines.",
        "With the SISHIP SiPOD-M, Siemens Energy offers a solution in the power range from 5-25 MW which allows maximum flexibility in vessel design and layout thanks to minimal space requirement on board.",
        "Twin propeller systems keep space requirements under the stern to an absolute minimum. The SISHIP SiPOD-T allows for more flexible ship designs and maximizes the payload capacity.",
        "To be prepared for on-site conditions, which can sometimes be harsh, the fully equipped SISHIP SiPOD Service Container contains both standard and special-purpose tools, lifting devices, as well as air conditioning and heating equipment.",
        "Power LV is an integrated, modular, and scalable system for providing a reliable and economical onboard power supply in low-voltage technology.",
        "Power MV is our solution for the onboard medium-voltage supply. It comprises all central components in medium-voltage technology.",
        "SISHIP Boost with WHRS is a waste heat recovery system for vessels that helps reduce your energy costs by up to 12 percent.",
        "The PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be significantly extended which minimizes the risk of beeing detected.",
        "The operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system.",
