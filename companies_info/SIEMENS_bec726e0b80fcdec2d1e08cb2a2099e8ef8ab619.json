        "When components need safeguarding, protection systems provide fast and reliable fault detection and reaction. Protection systems prevent potential causes of major damages such as shutdowns and the incorrect synchronization of generator to grid. Unfortunately, many installed systems are no longer adequately able to cope with protection tasks and their maintenance is becoming increasingly difficult. ",
        "Our unit protection and synchronization solution allows for the replacement of the unit and power system protection, as well as the replacement of the synchronization system. The package uses modern grid protection methodologies that satisfy the most sophisticated requirements when it comes to response precision. Our unit protection and synchronization solution complies with the latest grid requirements and is based on special hardware, redundant configuration, and instrumentation that incorporate diverse-mode measurements.",
