        "Based on proven aeroderivative design, the SGT-A05 gas turbines are flexible, compact and lightweight designs that are ideally suited for decentralized power generation offering high efficiency and fast start-up capabilities.",
        "The SGT-A05 gas turbine variants generate electrical power outputs between 4 and 6 MW for applications such as base load, co-generation, combined heat and power, mobile power and emergency power.",
        "The SGT-A05 is proven to operate in various challenging conditions and locations around the world, including the North Sea, West Africa, Siberia, Brazil, Alaska, Southeast Asia and the desert regions of the Middle East. The SGT-A05 engine has been shock-qualified to Mil-S-901C, which makes it particularly suitable for areas with frequent or severe seismic activity.",
        "The SGT-A05 is known for its high fuel flexibility, which will accommodate a wide variety of possible application scenarios and requirements. Fuels include, but are not limited to natural gas, liquid fuel (or both) and mid to low BTU gas fuels. Fuel system options include dual fuel, steam and water injection. Dry Low Emissions (DLE) technology is also available.",
        "Thanks to advanced engineering, the SGT-A05 gas turbine provides fast start-up capability: You will have full power available within 60 seconds in all conditions. This includes hot restarts, with no need to go into idle condition. The SGT-A05 engine also offers black start capability.",
        "Three popular, proven combustion systems that enhance profitability are available, based on your needs: - Standard combustion systems operate on liquid or gas fuel - Wet low emissions combustion systems utilize nozzle steam or water - Dry low emissions combustion systems for gas-fueled installations achieve emission levels of 25 vppm NOₓ and 50 vppm CO",
        "The SGT-A05 (Industrial 501-K) gas turbine engine is an aero-derived engine based on the T-56 turboprop, which is recognized for its reliability and durability in the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules transport, E2C Hawkeye, P-3 Orion and other widely used aircraft. The aeroderivative design of the SGT-A05 series engine provides a lightweight, modular product that helps lower operating costs through improved fuel consumption, extended hot section life and ease of maintenance. Designed for power generation, and oil and gas applications, features of the SGT-A05 gas turbine include:",
        "The SGT-A05 combines proven technology, state-of-the-art materials and technological solutions.",
        "Core engine and auxiliary equipment are factory pre-tested prior to delivery.",
        "The SGT-A05 (Industrial 501-K) packages are designed with noise suppression, access doorways, as well as safety interlocks supporting the health and safety of the operation and maintenance staff. The packages are compact and easily transported, installed and maintained.",
        "For power generation applications like cogeneration and emergency power applications, the package features include:",
        "A single-shaft version is available for constant speed operations in onshore and offshore configurations, e.g.,",
        "Our current offering includes variants of the proved SGT-A05 KB5 and SGT-A05 KB7 gas turbines. SGT-A05 variants are fulfilling the requirements of a wide spectrum of applications in terms of efficiency, reliability, flexibility and environmental compatibility. ",
        "The trailer-mounted unit is driven to its installation site, requiring minimal civil works preparation. From arrival to site to full power in under four hours, the light, aero-derivative SGT-A05 mobile power unit is ideal for rapid deployment.",
        "Our comprehensive portfolio of services provides low life cycle cost and optimum performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle: Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul service, field service, spare parts, service exchange, remote diagnostic service, and modernization and upgrades.",
        "The modular, compact design of the SGT-A05 facilitates on-site maintenance, since the modules can be quickly replaced.  A direct core engine exchange is possible and can be executed in as little as 12 hours. The proven lightweight industrial design allows an easy and economical transport. ",
        "Easy on-site maintenance due to core engine or module replacement.",
        "The SGT-A05 demonstrates reliable performance with up to 7 years of baseload operation between major overhauls.",
        "The SGT-A05 engine is designed to operate on a wide variety of fuels. Fuels include, but are not limited to, natural gas, liquid fuel (typically DF-2 or equivalent) and mid to low BTU gas fuels. Fuel system options also include dual fuel, steam and water injection. Dry Low Emissions (DLE) technology is also available.",
        "The well-proven and reliable Dry Low Emissions (DLE) system offers clean combustion for gas-fueled engines with low emissions for power generation applications. It achieves emission levels of 25 vppm NOₓ and 50 vppm CO. The Wet Low Emissions (WLE) system utilizes nozzle steam or water injection for liquid-fuel operation in order to meet the most stringent environmental requirements.",
        "In our download section, you can find brochures, technical papers, and more. Or you can contact us directly for specific inquiries.",
        "Technical papers",
        "With more than 55 years of operating experience, the SGT-A05 is proven in combined heat and power plant applications as well as emergency/standby applications. More than 1,675 units have been sold with more than 127 million hours of operating experience.",
