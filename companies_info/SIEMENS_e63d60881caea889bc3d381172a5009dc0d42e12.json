        "Our wide CO₂ compressor portfolio provides you with the most cost effective compression solution for your process. Whether your application is for CO₂ injection, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) or urea plants, we will work with you to achieve your economic and sustainability goals. There is growing demand and new business opportunities for reservoir owners to take off, inject and store CO₂ and with our proven, best in class compressor technologies we can work towards decarbonizing your process.",
        "In this webinar series our experts discuss integrally geared compressors and their applications, providing you with a deeper understanding of this compression technology and the advancements shaping the industry.",
        "We recognize that our customers are under regulatory and reputational pressure to reduce emissions whilst continuing to optimize production. Working with you towards the energy transition, we are exploring efficient ways to handle problem gas while increasing your energy efficiency through operational changes.",
        "Giving you the power of choice with solutions from our reciprocating, single-shaft and integrally geared compressor portfolios, we have the broadest application range.",
        "Scope: 2x integrally geared compressors with dry gas seals The only existing subsea pipeline injection currently operating in the world. Natural Gas in the Snohvit field contains 5-8% CO₂ which is separated, compressed, liquefied and pumped back via subsea pipeline into reservoir",
        "Scope: Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study to support heat integration and optimization, compressor selectionDOE-supported design and costing study for retrofitting Nebraska Public Power District Gerald Gentleman Station with a 90% CO₂ capture system",
        "Scope: 4x compressor trains – high density centrifugal compressors for CO₂ re-injection serviceReduced capital expenditure, footprint, weight, and operating costs, while increasing reliability by eliminating the need to install, operate and maintain high-pressure injection pumping systems downstream of the compression system",
        "Scope: Over 90 High Speed Reciprocating Compressors supplied to develop stranded reserves of oil from depleted reservoirsIncreased oil production with CO2 EOR",
        "CO2 compressor for carbon capture project for hydrogen producing steam methane reformers. The compressor supplies a high pressure CO2 pipeline for enhanced oil recovery.1 million metric tons of CO2 captured and stored per year (&gt;90% capture rate). The captured CO2 is expected to increase oil field output by 60-90 million barrels.",
