        "Our portfolio of digital solutions and the platform they are built upon helps customers take advantage of digitalization. Today, we offer solutions that range from remote monitoring systems to systems that maximize availability, reliability and security. Many customers have already deployed these solutions.",
        "Hitachi Energy has for many years worked with digital solutions, supporting the reliability and availability of our customers' installations. Our services are built from our HVDC knowledge, operational and information technology, digital expertise, knowledge of critical infrastructure, and comprise cybersecurity for HVDC, software updates and backups for HVDC, and maintenance based on digital tools and systems.",
        "We offer update packages to bring older installations closer to the functionality we supply in today’s installations. Software updates that improve reliability, add functionality and accessibility, secure spare part availability and increase overall performance.",
        "Software updates also includes updates to computer operating systems, security, malware detection, or specific updates tailored to the customer needs, such as vulnerability management.",
        "We manage preventive and corrective maintenance programs. Preventive maintenance helps you to check the condition of your system and its components. It will determine the best solution to ensure system performance, safety, availability and reliability.",
        "We design for maintainability, and use digital tools to minimize maintenance outage periods. In addition, our recommendations are based on input from our sub-suppliers, and experience from our field engineers and experts. These recommendations are continuously updated with new knowledge and experiences.",
        "Using internet based communication technologies requires protection against cyber attacks. Viruses, ransomware and other malware have increased the awareness and need for cybersecurity methods. Cybersecurity must be addressed continuously, which requires a comprehensive program including human resources with the appropriate skills.",
        "Cybersecurity is a key requirement and we are committed to providing products, systems and services that clearly address this issue. We take a systematic approach to cybersecurity through our operations on a global level.",
        "We optimize and extend your equipment life",
        "We optimize connectivity, reliability and efficiency of your assets",
        "We keep the power flowing 24/7",
        "HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations.",
        "HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used.",
        "Electricity is converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa in a converter station. This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves.",
        "The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.",
        "IdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time.",
