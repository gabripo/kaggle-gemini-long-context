        "Distribution transformers enable safe voltage levels for power consumption. But they are often located in densely populated areas or close to sensitive ecosystems. Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards.",
        "Apart from being oil-free, all components of dry-type transformers are in solid form; they do not have flash points or require bushings. Thus, major causes of fire and oil spillage are eliminated. The majority of insulating components used dry-type transformers can also be easily recycled. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for dry-type transformers is much lower due to the lower cost of installation and the need for a fire suppression system.\n",
        "Hitachi Energy has been leading the development, manufacturing, and supply of dry-type transformers for more than 40 years - with path-leading technological innovation. Hitachi Energy offers a full range of dry-type transformers with primary voltages through 72.5 kV built according to all major standards, including IEC and ANSI. \n",
        "With recent technological advances, Hitachi Energy has successfully designed and installed a dry-type transformer that can withstand 100 kV / 550kV Basic Impulse Level (BIL). Thus paving the way for using this sustainable and environment-friendly transformer technology at even sub-transmission level.\n",
        "These transformers meet strict parameters with respect to electrical system demands and functioning in areas with extreme climatic conditions. Hitachi Energy's dry and cast transformers are virtually maintenance-free and are manufactured in accordance with industry and international standards, including ISO 9001.",
