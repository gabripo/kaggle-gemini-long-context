        "Shore-to-ship power helps to reduce polluting emissions, noise and vibration in ports by connecting vessels to the port electricity grid and allowing them to shut down the onboard power generation units while at berth. Since most ships operate with 60 Hz electricity whereas local grid in most parts of the world is 50 Hz, Hitachi Energy static frequency converters help to adjust the grid electricity to the appropriate ship frequency and are a viable solution in replacing vintage rotating frequency converters (motor/generator set).",
        "Hitachi Energy frequency converters are an economic and efficient solution to convert the grid electricity to the appropriate frequency needed on board. Thanks to a complementary product portfolio consisting of ACS 6080 SFC, ACS 880 SFC and PCS 100 SFC we are able to offer adequate frequency converter solutions ranging from 100 kVA up to 27 MVA (higher power available when paralleling multiple converters).\n\nThe Hitachi Energy offering spans from frequency conversion engineered packages to comprehensive turnkey shore-to-ship power solutions from the connection to the public power grid to the installation on ships. ",
