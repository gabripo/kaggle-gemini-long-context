        "Modernizing an HVDC installation has been shown to extend system lifetime, improve availability and reliability, increase cost efficiency, improve performance, increase the capacity, and increase the power rating of the link.",
        "After some years of operation, an assessment and upgrade of the equipment or systems can extend a system’s life-cycle and reduce downtime. Not only can new generation hardware and software provide new functionalities, but the upgrade can be completed within a relatively short downtime, and is a proven, efficient way to prolong high performance. Hitachi Energy is a world-leader in upgrading HVDC links, and upgrades older installations to modern systems.",
        "Proactively upgrading a system before a severe outage occurs can save time and money. The need for upgrading depends mainly on age, the general condition of the equipment, and the potential unavailability of spare parts.",
        "An upgrade may consist of a new control system, new functionality and a new generation of hardware and software.",
        "Upgrades of one or more of the following, can be addressed as partial upgrades:",
        "Partial upgrades of the MACH control system can be tailored to customer needs.",
        "The right part, at the right place, in the right time is our goal.",
        "Hitachi Energy strives to continuously increase the lifetime of your components. Using high-quality spare parts management, we are able to inform you what spare parts are needed to minimize unnecessary downtime.",
        "Together we manage your assets, operations and risk",

        "We keep the power flowing 24/7",
        "HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations.",
        "HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used.",
        "Electricity is converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa in a converter station. This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves.",
        "The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.",
        "IdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time.",
