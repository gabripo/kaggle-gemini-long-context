        "The excitation system plays a major role in ensuring the reliable continuous operation of synchronous generators, since it significantly influences the operational readiness and dynamics of the generator. Moreover, it controls the reactive power response of the synchronous machine. Innovative excitation systems, especially designed for power plants, assume center stage when maximum reliability is required.",
        "After years in operation, long-serving excitation equipment is often no longer up to the task. Components of the excitation system may have been discontinued, the frequency of outages becomes unacceptable and grid operators impose new demands on control dynamics.",
        "No matter your footprint, power supply or generator output, Siemens Energy can offer the right excitation system for any application in any power plant. ",
        "The static excitation system (SES) is a tried-and-tested solution for synchronous machines (generators, motors and synchronous condensers). SES can be used as a stand-alone system or as a compact system in combination with a start-up frequency converter.  ",
        "Our solution adapts perfectly to the conditions in both newly built or upgraded power plants, regardless of the space conditions, generator type, power supply or control system and regardless of whether the control system is also being replaced at the same time, as well as whether there is a hard-wired or bus connection.",

        "The compound excitation system (CES) is a tried-and-tested solution for synchronous generators of any manufacturer and can be used both as a static excitation system for generators and for excitation of rotating excitation machines. Over 300 installations in operation have demonstrated the unconditional reliability and robustness for years.",
        "Our solution adapts to the conditions in each individual power plant regardless of the available footprint, which generator is used and which power supply and control system is available.",
        "The brushless excitation systems (BES) is a tried-and-tested solution for all generators with exciters. For many years now, more than 1700 brushless excitation systems have been demonstrating the highest levels of reliability and robustness.",
        "Our solution can be adapted to conditions in each individual power plant due to the high degree of flexibility of the supply concepts.",
        "DIGUREG is a compact voltage regulator, designed and tested in accordance with the relevant IEEE 421.5 standards and has an integrated power module. It is intended for synchronous machines with exciter sets and rotating diodes. DIGUREG is suitable for being used in steam turbine, gas turbine and hydroelectric power plants.  ",
        "max. continuous current: 34 A ",
        "max. continuous current: 16 A",
        " Maximum reliability thanks to robust design suitable for power plants",
        " Low maintenance costs due to use of proven industrial components",
        " Minimum time for replacement of the existing excitation system with no changes to the I&C or the exciter",
        "To guarantee the best  solution for each individual case, we first analyze the current situation and the required modifications. We identify which components need replacing, which technology is most suitable, and how the new system can most easily be integrated into the existing plant architecture.",
        "Our primary goal is to achieve unconditional reliability and reduced maintenance costs for our customer's excitation system. For this, we offer excitation systems that fit perfectly into existing plants and processes.",
        "The Siemens Energy turnkey excitation system solution includes all necessary equipment, components and services.",
        "We appreciate your interest in our products. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to contact us!",
