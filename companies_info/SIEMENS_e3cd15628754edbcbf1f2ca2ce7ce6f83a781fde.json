        "In today's complex power market Siemens Energy is a strong partner capable of providing you with competitive power plant solutions to improve the profitability of your business. We offer both simple cycle and combined cycle power plants turnkey from a single source. Tailored for your specific needs and challenges of the market.  ",
        "Are you looking for a highly efficient combined cycle power plant to cover base load at reasonable cost? Or a robust simple cycle power plant that will cover peak loads under tough conditions? Siemens Energy will develop and build the solution you need: simple and combined cycle power plants, with or without combined heat and power (CHP), flexible and sustainable. You can rely on proven technologies that will pay off throughout the entire lifetime of your power plant – technologies that set the standards in efficiency and reliability, and are fit to meet future challenges.",
        "The next level of efficiency and performance ",
        "With our HL-class gas turbine we are paving the way to the next level for higher power plant efficiency and performance. This evolutionary development step, derived from proven H-class technology, combines a series of new but already tested technologies. The result: A technology carrier to the next level with a combined cycle efficiency beyond 64% and a clear midterm goal of 65%. The HL-class consists of two engines:  SGT5-9000HL and SGT6-9000HL.",

        "Reduce greenhouse gas emissions: an H-class power plant operates at high efficiency and with low emissions, even at part-load. We ensure that exhaust emissions are kept to a minimum even when starting up and shutting down – for you to comply with all relevant directives. We can even keep plants with SCR technology under 2 ppm NOx and CO while ramping with our unique Clean-Ramp™ technology.\n",

        "A high output with low electricity generation costs:  F-class power plants offer high power output and a world-class efficiency. Combined with a proven availability of more than 95 percent,  you can concentrate on other matters and leave your power plant to pay for itself. Whether you need a single or multi-shaft application, with or without a steam turbine – you’ll get a plant that perfectly fits your needs.",
        "Keeping an eye on costs: F-class power plants are especially service-friendly. Longer service intervals keep maintenance costs down – which means you get an ideal balance between capital costs, plant performance, and operating costs.\n",

        "New gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability.",
