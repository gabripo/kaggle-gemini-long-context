        "Edge-enabled, high-voltage products will build the foundation for the Internet of Energy (IoE).  At the same time, edge technology on the product and substation level is complementary to the cloud on the enterprise level.",
        "Edge computing is increasingly impacting many industries, including the energy sector. Edge-enabled, high-voltage products will build the foundation for the Internet of Energy (IoE). Read more about it in our whitepaper. ",
        "Fluctuating power flow and exponential increase of grid complexity need more flexible assets with higher capabilities far beyond the current monitoring, control and automation systems.",
        "For an interoperable, digital and decentralized network, it is necessary to interconnect high-voltage transmission products in the substation like transformers, switchgears and circuit breakers per default. Operational data of intelligent assets can be analyzed in real-time and recommendations to improve performance can be implemented. This kind of integration and operation builds the Internet of Energy (IoE) for the grids of the future. The Siemens Energy Edge portfolio is the next generation of digitally enabled transmission products, systems and solutions. It can be independent or integrated into either a enterprise network or interoperate with the cloud.",
        "Edge products combine the strengths of local and high-performance data processing directly within the on-prem system with the benefits offered by the cloud: app-based data analytics, data processing and storage concepts, update and versioning of applications as well as a corresponding management of devices. Your data does not leave your local substation network, giving you the extra flexibility in making informed and timely decisions.",
