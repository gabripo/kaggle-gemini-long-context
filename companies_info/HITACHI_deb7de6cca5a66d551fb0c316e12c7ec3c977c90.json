        "Build, operate and maintain HVDC converter stations with sustainability in mind",
        "Learn how the HVDC technology makes it possible to increase integration of offshore wind power generation into the grid and accelerates green energy transition in Europe.",
        "Learn how Hitachi Energy has embraced the challenge and opportunity to realized Combined Grid Solutions, a case that could become more and more common in the years to come.",
        "Learn how the HVDC technology from Hitachi Energy makes it possible to increase stability and controllability of the grid and retain power transmission in the network.",
        "High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is a key enabler for a carbon-neutral energy system. It is highly efficient for transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances, integration of renewables and interconnecting grids, opening up for new sustainable transmission solutions.",
        "HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations.",
        "HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used.",
        "Hitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world.",
        "The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.",
        "IdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time.",
        "An HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks.",
        "Cables and small converter stations - HVDC has great potential for city applications.",
        "HVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day.",
        "Avoid using expensive fuel in small uneconomic plants - make an HVDC connection to a larger grid.",
        "DC technology provides a more secure and optimized control of a network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout.",
        "Being proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown.",
        "In many regions of the world, liberalized energy markets have introduced the phenomenon of trading to electricity sectors and trading is enabled by coupling electricity markets with network interconnections.",
        "Hitachi Energy's technology for the offshore wind power industry is essential in the transmission of high quality power with minimal loss.",
        "Many classical HVDC systems use overhead transmission lines. In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations.",
        "HVDC Light® can be used to deliver power both to and from offshore platforms.",
