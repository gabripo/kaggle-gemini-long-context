        "The SGT-700 is derived from the SGT-600 and is designed to offer you higher output and efficiency as well as lower emissions with a wide fuel range capability.",
        "This gas turbine is an ideal fit for power generation and mechanical drive applications. With the high exhaust heat, it is also excellent for cogeneration as well as for combined cycle applications.",
        "The SGT-700 offers best-in-class fuel flexibility that allows for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons: ",
        "The SGT-700 features a third-generation dual-fuel Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system:",
        "The SGT-700 features a reliable, robust and easily maintainable design for maximized uptime.",
        "Thanks to a long lifetime with maximized uptime, low lifecycle cost and easy servicability, the SGT-700 offers you a high lifetime profitability. The robust industrial design offers a low degradation over time.",
        "The SGT-700 provides the best availability of its class, thanks to a robust and well-proven design. The compact twin-shaft engine is easy to maintain and allows for flexible operation with excellent efficiency at part load conditions.",
        "Using the same design for power generation and mechanical drive increases the operational reliability.",
        "The SGT-700 employs an 11-stage axial-flow transonic compressor incorporating the latest aerodynamics, with variable guide vanes for robust operability and optimized performance over a wide range of operating conditions.",
        "The 2-stage uncooled free power turbine offers a nominal shaft speed of up to 6,500 rpm. For mechanical drive, it may operate at 50 to 105 % of the nominal speed. The  power turbine can be matched for optimal performance at different ambient conditions.",
        "The SGT-700 package offers you a small footprint and excellent serviceability. It features a modular and flexible design with single-lift capability. ",
        "The driver for both the power generation and the mechanical drive package is the same.",
        "A gas turbine package includes:",
        "Gas turbine, enclosure, base frame, air intake, exhaust, lubricating systems, starter system, vibration monitoring system, firefighting system, package ventilation system, instrumentation, gas detection, fuel systems, gearbox (if needed).",
        "The SGT-700 is ideal for simple cycle, combined cycle, cogeneration, and other heating applications thanks to its high exhaust temperature and the ability to handle sudden load changes.",
        "Extreme desert and arctic climates, or harsh industrial environments are not expected to impair the SGT-700 mechanical drive package’s long service life.",
        "For combined cycle and cogeneration (combined heat and power – CHP), Siemens offers a broad range of power plant configurations and scopes based on the SGT-700 gas turbine. For combined cycle, 1x1 or 2x1 configurations are part of the standardized portfolio.",
        "High combined cycle performance: In a 2x1 combined cycle configuration, the power output is 91.6 MW(e) at a net plant efficiency of 53.1%.",
        "The SGT-700 is designed for maximized serviceability.",
        "Our remote diagnostic service helps you to detect faults at an early stage and prevents outages.",
        "The service includes online monitoring, expert performance data analysis, and fleet data comparisons.",
        "The SGT-700 offers best-in-class fuel flexibility that allows for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons:",
        "The SGT-700 requires low gas supply pressure at site: 28 bar(a) / 406 psi(a). Fuel changeover (gas to liquid fuel and liquid fuel to gas) on load.",
        "The combustor and burner design give world-class emission performance over a wide load range and are capable of low NOₓ emission levels. Low emission levels are also received on liquid fuel without need of water injection.",
        "Emissions for 100 – 50% load, NOₓ at 15% O₂:",
        "Emissions for 100 - 50% load, CO at 15% O₂:",
        "(Emissions depend upon site conditions, required load range and other project-specific data.) ",
        "In our download section, you can find brochures, technical papers, and more. Or you can contact us directly for specific inquiries.",
        "Technical papers",
        "More than 85 units have been sold with over 2 million equivalent operating hours. The fleet-leading gas turbine has over 100,000 equivalent operating hours.",
