        "The global demand for transport is growing fast. Based on present trends, passenger and freight transportation activities will more than double by 2050. This growth carries with it greater energy demand, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and atmospheric pollutants. Rail travel has been well-matched to a world that is becoming more urbanized. ",
        "Rail is among the most energy-efficient modes of transport for freight and passengers. Its heavy reliance on electricity makes the rail sector the most energy-diverse mode of transport. We help our customers meet their mobility demand for green, safe, reliable, and efficient railways with low operating costs. ",

        "Railway trackside transformers are used in the railway industry to supply power to rail network infrastructure for rolling stock and to feed power to applications and systems at the safest level: Railway networks, metro power systems, tram systems, airport passenger transportation on rail, and any other power network used to feed power to rolling stock.",
        "Hitachi Energy has the broadest portfolio of dry-type and liquid-filled transformers, covering all rail infrastructure applications with a global footprint. ",
        "Traction transformers are critical components in the rail traction chain, affecting train performance and operator services. Hitachi Energy supplies traction transformers for all applications: high-speed, commuter, and regional trains, locomotives, tram-trains, and AC metros. It offers different designs in terms of size, weight, and power ratings.",
        "Most of the world’s train manufacturers and rail operators rely on Hitachi Energy traction transformers.",
        "Auxiliary Transformers and Reactors are high-performing components suitable for both AC and DC catenary systems and can also be provided as a combined solution for demanding customer applications.",
        "Aging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging utilities and industries around the world. While financial constraints are reducing maintenance budgets and investment, demand for increased return on investment is unchanged. Our service portfolio allows utilities and industrials to maximize the return on transformer assets by ensuring high reliability, reducing life cycle costs, and optimizing performance while lowering environmental impact. ",
        "Hitachi Energy provides services throughout the complete transformer life cycle, from commissioning to recycling, for all brands and kinds of transformers. Our archives contain technical information for more than 30 legacy brands. Our guiding theme is responsiveness.",
