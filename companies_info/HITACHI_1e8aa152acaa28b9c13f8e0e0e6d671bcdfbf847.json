        "Our on-site repair is achieved by bringing the transformer factory setup to the work site. TrafoSiteRepair™ service is executed to the same high-quality standard as a workshop repair. This is done by mobilizing special equipment and tools needed to perform any scope of work, from refurbishment and upgrades to replacing all windings manufactured in transformer factories under strict quality standards.​",
        "TrafoSiteRepair™ has been used worldwide to repair over 400 transformers, including ultra high-voltage and converter transformers, industrial units, and shunt reactors. ​",
        "TrafoSiteRepair™ has saved utilities and industrial users millions of dollars by reducing downtime in installations where production losses per day can be extremely high. With on-site repair, transport to a repair facility can be avoided, reducing risk and saving cost and time.​",
        "Significant progress in power electronics led Hitachi Energy to develop TrafoSiteTesting™, a compact high-voltage test system, and Low-Frequency Heating, a special Hitachi Energy technology for high-temperature transformer drying out in the field. TrafoSiteTesting™ enables on-site high-voltage laboratory testing such as applied and induced voltage tests with partial discharge measurements, heat run, and lightning impulse tests.​",
        "TrafoSiteTesting™ may also be used for condition assessment (preventive measure), transformer troubleshooting (failure identification and localization), and as an extra quality check measure on new units after transportation and installation.​",
        "Low-frequency heating technology decreases the drying time by more than 50% compared to conventional methods and can reduce moisture in cellulose to less than 1%.​\r\n​\r\nTrafoSiteRepair™ provides customers with a complete transformer on-site solution by combining state-of-the-art Hitachi Energy´s technology and materials, our extensive experience with its legacy brands, and support from the local and global network in more than 30 countries.",
