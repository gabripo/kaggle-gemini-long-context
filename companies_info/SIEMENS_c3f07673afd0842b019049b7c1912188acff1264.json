        "Whether your business is an industry, campus, municipality, infrastructure facility or data centre, you need an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy supply. Our portfolio provides efficient power generation on your site, when and where you need it, thereby securing energy supply for the future.",
        "Our portfolio reflects the world's shift from large CO₂ intensive technologies into a diverse energy landscape consisting of smaller, decentralised power providers, consumers and prosumers, who are looking for solutions that ensure stable and cost-efficient operations with less emissions. ",
        "With the establishment of climate objectives and the ongoing transition to renewable energy, the utilization of fossil fuels is expected to diminish. In the context of heat and power generation, the need for flexibility and self-reliance in fuel choices is becoming increasingly crucial. Green fuels can be one solution.",
        "How can we build a flexible and sustainable energy system with gas turbines, renewable energy sources and energy storage? As power from solar and wind is volatile and doesn’t always match the energy demand, hydrogen produced from these green energy sources can be used as an energy storage solution and used as fuel in the gas turbines to balance the grid.",
        "... aspects of distributed power generation that you would never have thought might influence your business now or in the near future.",
        "First introduced in Singapore in 1975, such zones are nowadays located in cities worldwide. Car traffic limitations, tree planting. What else? Look at the sidewalk. Do you notice any ventilation grids? There might be a diesel backup engine of a hospital, office or data center beneath your feet.",
        "Even modern, diesel-fueled backup generators of Tier-4 standards could lead to high concentrations of poisonous exhaust plumes in urban street canyons which may explain why gas turbines, and batteries have become the preferred backup power source for many data centers. ",
        "The World Bank has announced the Thirsty Energy Initiative. The World Energy Council has published The Road to Resilience Report - Managing the Risks of the energy-water-food nexus. In April 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation presented the 2-year forecast which could lead to the first water shortage declaration in the Western United States.",
        "Let´s save water for drinking. Combine a gas turbine with Organic Rankin Cycle (ORC) technology for waste heat recovery without water in a  Heat ReCycle powerplant. Soon, cutting-edge technology will allow upgrading the gas turbine to burn 100% hydrogen in DLE (dry low emissions). ",
        "You stand at the forefront of the energy transition. You manage it actively and with confidence. You choose your customized mix of power generation technologies - e.g. wind farms, photovoltaic plants, and combined heat and power (CHP) with heat pumps and energy storage solutions.",
        "You choose solutions that balance sustainability and economic efficiency. Catching the wave, you see the market opportunities arising due to the integration of heating and cooling and soaring market demand for excess power generation. Interconnecting technologies enable you to optimize energy costs while supporting the transformation to a more sustainable energy system.",
        "You are ready for any scenario, and combine the security of supply with new business models, including regular servicing intervals and remote service inspections.",
        "You are never shy of using new technologies that allow you to show your full potential, even if the municipality or utility is located in an area where land is scarce or on an island.",
        "Of course, you are walking on the path to carbon neutrality.",
        "Any step you take, the first thing that comes to  mind is resilient power generation. The second  is cost optimisation. You take control and safeguard your power for years to come by generating power on-site using reliable technologies that would secure the future energy supply.",
        "Naturally, distributed power generation is what you rely on, as you can use the benefits of the methodology of optimisation of energy mix, energy-efficiency increases, smart consumption reduction and resilience. ",
        "Careful as you may be, you are assured of a servicing infrastructure at hand. ",
        "You realize the potential of your plant. With on-site energy generation and storage, you optimize all energy matters from generation and consumption up to re-use. ",
        "Dependence is a word you do not have in your business dictionary. On-site solutions provide a resilient power supply, which safeguards your processes. These solutions include waste to energy, CHP - combined heating and cooling and power generation and the integration of renewables. ",
        "A local energy solution gives you also control over costs in respect of the grid, and even has the potential of creating revenue by enabling active participation in the energy market. ",
        "You carefully analyse trends in your industry and adjust your business to future demand. On-site power generation develops together with your plant, allowing you to use fuel flexibly and increase output to cover your future growth.",

        "Combined cycle cogeneration power plants",
        "Grupo Kaltex | Altamira, Mexico | Industrial, Textiles",
        "Siemens  Energy gas turbines fulfill the high requirements of a wide spectrum of applications in terms of efficiency, reliability, flexibility and environmental compatibility.",
        "We are setting standards for steam-based power production. Siemens Energy steam turbines are an ideal choice for cogeneration. More than 20,000 are currently in operation around the world.",
        "Siemens Energy generators ranging from 25 to 2,235 MVA achieve efficiency levels of up to 99 percent. Around the globe, more than 2,500 units from our SGen™ series are generating power today.",
        "Small hydro power plants have proven to be a sustainable source of energy. Learn more about Siemens Energy’s comprehensive solutions that turn water into energy.",
        "Increase the flexibility, efficiency, reliability, and availability of your power generation assets throughout their entire lifecycle – with service solutions from our highly skilled and deeply committed Siemens Energy Service Experts.",
        "Heat pumps are an efficient and cost-effective solution for the generation of heat and cold. Proven high and low temperature heat pumps for up to 150°C and 70 MWth",
