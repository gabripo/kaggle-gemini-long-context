        "The innovative EconiQ retrofill solution uses eco-efficient fluoronitrile based gas mixture to replace SF6 in installed gas-insulated lines. This can be done with minimum changes to existing equipment while ensuring performance of the equipment and significantly lowering environmental impact.\n",
        "In this process, SF6 from the installed gas-insulated lines is evacuated and filled into gas bottles for recycling or disposal and the GIL is then flushed to remove any humidity. The new eco-efficient gas mixture is then filled into the GIL and the switchgear is re-energized to connect back to the grid. The process is relatively quick and enables the reuse of passive gas components designed for SF6 to be converted into non-SF6 equipment, thereby improving their environmental and lifecycle performance.",
