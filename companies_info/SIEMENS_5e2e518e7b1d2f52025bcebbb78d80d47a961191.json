        "Well-trained operations and maintenance personnel are vital to operating your plant safely, efficiently and productively. By fully utilizing our expert knowledge from millions of equivalent operating hours of data, advanced component models, and with more than 100 years of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) service experience, we can improve your in-house capabilities to help you get the most out of your equipment. ",
        "Our instructors have decades of experience in training our customers on how to safely operate and maintain Siemens Energy and Dresser-Rand compressors and turbines. Training is offered virtually or in the classroom through lectures, hands-on programs in the lab and training centers, and at your location.",
        "Learn how to operate and maintain reciprocating compressors, centrifugal compressors, steam turbines and gas turbines.",
        "Our training courses are designed for operators, mechanics, maintenance supervisors and reliability engineers who work on Siemens Energy and/or Dresser-Rand equipment. Whether introductory level or advanced, we have many classes to choose from to enhance your core competencies in turbomachinery. We also customize training to your company's specific needs, based on your drawings, systems, and simulating your gas turbine or compression software.",
        "Start your training with the fundamentals, gain an understanding of the model variations, dive deeper into the operating equipment, troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance.",
        "The hands-on portion requires you to sequentially disassemble, inspect, measure, record and reassemble in a safe manner, with our instructors guiding you along the way. You learn how to navigate and interpret the service manual to determine procesdures, specifications and torque valves.",
        "We provide tailor-made Long Term Training Programs (LTP) for your equipment, either at a location of your choice or at our purpose-built Training Center in Duisburg, Germany. ",
        "With LTP training options extending up to five years, we can provide a fully customizable plan that can be flexibly adjusted at any time, according to your equipment and resource requirements. You can choose for your training to be part of a standard LTP or a dedicated, independent training program.",
        "We offer a wide variety of LTP training approaches globally, to suit your individual needs:",
        "Choose your training topics, content and delivery approach - the choice is yours.....",
        "When training in the simulation room, you feel like you are operating a turbine under realistic operating conditions.  Practice starting and stopping the machinery; add faults to give you the opportunity to trouble shoot for the first line fault training.",
