        "With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, this 72.5 - 145 kV circuit breaker makes a greener grid achievable",
        "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker.",
        "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. ",
        "The only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.",
        "The clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.",
        "At the same time, the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe.",

        "Dealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues.",
        "By Frank Jossi",
        "In line with shared commitments to decarbonize, National Grid and Siemens Energy are teaming up to undertake a cutting-edge upgrade of a National Grid substation using Siemens Energy designed fluorinated gas free “Blue circuit breakers” with clean air insulation and vacuum switching technology.",
        "While we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. ",
        "Our dead tank breaker family is available for applications from 72.5 kV up to 550 kV and for short-circuit interruption up to 90 kA. DT breakers up to 362 kV are equipped with one interrupter unit per pole, up to 550 kV with two interrupter units. ",
        "We provide dead tank circuit breakers with 2-cycle operation for applications up to 362 kV. The circuit breakers can be equipped with optional closing resistors or applications from 362 kV to 550 kV. Several current transformer solutions are at your disposal which can be realized according to your specific project requirements.",
        "Our high-voltage dead tank circuit breakers are available for three-pole operation with a common base, for single-pole operation also with a common base or for single-pole operation with separate bases.",
        "You can find details on our dead tank circuit breakers and information about our services here.",
