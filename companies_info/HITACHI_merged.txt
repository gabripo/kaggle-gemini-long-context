The page with name "Upgrade, Repair, & Extend | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend" has the following content:
Power transformers are the most important components of electrical energy supply networks. Although these components have high reliability, failures can occur due to external factors such as short circuits in the grid. Failures can also occur due to the aging effects of the active part, especially the insulation system, or the aging of important accessories such as bushings or on-load tap changers. In case of failure, the first action is to identify the type of failure. The aim is to localize the failure and its root cause.​
​
Repairing a transformer instead of replacing it can substantially reduce investment costs and provide a faster turnaround than buying a new transformer. Furthermore, to maximize the asset's technical life, a refurbishment or overhaul can be an intermediate action when no failure has occurred, and the aging of the active part has reached a stage where the continued reliability of the transformer is unacceptable.​ 
Upgrade, repair, and extend services are frequently used options that can be performed either in an authorized service workshop or at the customer site. The reconditioned equipment undergoes complete testing and comes with a warranty.

Being proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown. Based on many years of experience from complex installations, Hitachi Energy offers services to evolve or upgrade the installation to the next generation, to extend system lifetime, to improve availability and reliability. 
Based on many years of experience from complex installations, Hitachi Energy offers services to evolve or upgrade the installation to the next generation, to extend system lifetime, to improve availability and reliability and to avoid being outdated. There are several reasons to upgrade a system. First, many installations are critical for the supported system, transmission, or network. Additionally, there are challenges to maintain competence in limited and obsolete technologies when key staff members leave the company. 
Proactively upgrading the installation before a severe outage occurs can save time and money. The parts of a FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems) installations that are 15 years or older, may be in need of an upgrade. 
The need for upgrading depends mainly on the general condition of the equipment and the potential unavailability of spare parts. An upgrade may consist of a new control system, new functionality and a new generation of hardware and software.

Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. 
Our RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.

The page with name "Switchsync® PWC600 | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/switchsync" has the following content:
Controlled switching contributes to mitigating harmful electrical transients upon planned switching of capacitor banks, shunt reactors, power transformers, power cables, and transmission lines. The method is also gaining acceptance for re-energizing of EHV transmission lines, replacing traditional pre-insertion resistors. Since 1986, thousands of Switchsync controllers have been delivered all over the world. 
Switchsync PWC600 is Hitachi Energy's latest generation of point-on-wave controllers. Offering the full functionality and reliability of previous Switchsync products, it additionally includes Ethernet interfaces, which support modern communication protocols, and enhanced functionality and flexibility towards the user. 
Switchsync PWC600 is designed for single-pole operated circuit breakers, controlling each pole to close and/or open at the optimal point on the wave for the switched load, the circuit breaker, and power quality. It features unprecedented flexibility for switching various loads with diverse configurations, comprehensive monitoring functionality to track circuit breaker behavior, and handling multiple loads connected to the same breaker. For power transformers, PWC600 can estimate the residual fluxes in the core to minimize energization transients under all switching scenarios. For transmission lines, PWC600 can detect secondary arcs and predict the non-periodic gap voltage across the circuit breaker after a protection trip, to minimize switching overvoltages and prevent missing current zeros during auto-reclosing. It compensates for variations in environmental factors and drifts in circuit breaker properties. An intuitive configuration tool and local and web-based user interfaces facilitate easy access to the relevant functions. The product offers waveforms and operations recording facility with time & date stamping to assist in interpreting the controlled switching performance. 
Hitachi Energy's high-voltage circuit breakers are well suited for controlled switching, featuring consistent operating times and steep and stable dynamic dielectric withstand capability.

The page with name "Tap-changer Overhaul and Upgrades | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade/tap-changer-overhaul-and-upgrade" has the following content:
Proper Load and/or On-Load Tap-Changer (LTC / OLTC) maintenance has become increasingly complex, even for the best utility and industrial managers. Factors resulting from interconnections and power networks to aging equipment and the declining pool of technical experts add to the challenge. 
Tap-changers are very important components in transformers and the power grid. As they are of mechanical construction, they cause concern due to their maintenance needs and their failure probability. It is, therefore, important to ensure the integrity of tap-changers as cost-effectively and reliably as possible. Moreover, reports from international studies made by, for example, CIGRE show that faults associated with tap-changers are the origin of up to one-third of the transformer failures in service. 
When you evaluate the liability of a single tap changer failure at today’s costs, establishing an effective maintenance strategy becomes a matter no one can ignore. Hitachi Energy offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to effectively maintain many manufacturers’ tap changers, including ABB, Westinghouse, Reinhausen, Moloney, GE, National Industri, and others. Our tap changer program can supplement existing in-house programs or work independently to satisfy the total maintenance need. The Hitachi Energy tap-changer team provides support 24/7, and all field services are furnished by Hitachi Energy's qualified technicians and engineers. 
For services ranging from documentation and design engineering to the latest in testing and oil processing to providing 100 percent OEM grade parts and life extension kits, Hitachi Energy is the best resource for all tap changer service requirements. 
Our tap-changer services increase transformer life and reliability and lower maintenance and operating costs. In order to further assist our customers, Hitachi Energy offers a wide range of monitoring and diagnostic tools, from the simple way to monitor the temperature difference between the LTC/OLTC and the transformer main tank to the most advanced solutions on the market, for example, CoreTec™. This will allow a more refined diagnosis of LTC/OLTC problems to predict maintenance/overhaul needs based on actual conditions and not on the number of switching operations. 
In order to further lower maintenance and operating costs, Hitachi Energy has introduced a plug-and-play concept. This means the possibility of upgrading an old oil-breaking tap changer's type UCG and UCL to vacuum technology. A work that is as easy as normal maintenance.

Hitachi Energy's cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. Hitachi Energy offers a complete pure cooling system portfolio for industrial and power transmission applications with cooling capacity from 2 kW to several megawatts. 
Hitachi Energy's pure water cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. The cooling media in our solutions is water. The specific application determines when to use tap water, glycol water, or pure water. 
Our cooling system solutions are available for every stage of the product life cycle from development, design, sales and production, to assembly, testing, installation, commissioning, training and service. 
Our cooling media is water. The quality of water needed is determined by the specific application:  
Pure water - when water with low conductivity is needed 
Power electronic applications such as: 
Tap water - when conductivity is no issue 
Applications include 
Glycol/water mixture - when there is a risk for freezing 
The principle of all pure-water cooling systems is fundamentally the same. There is a main loop cooling the object. Water transfers the heat to water-to-water or water-to-air heat exchangers. From the main loop a small part of the flow passes a water-processing circuit. The water is filtered mechanically. If necessary, it is also continuously purified from ions and oxygen. The conductivity of the cooling water can be maintained as low as <0.1µS/cm (at 25°C). 
Our cooling systems are prefabricated and assembled in one or several units. Most of the systems include control equipment with PLC and software. The systems are tested and verified before delivery. 
As we deliver systems globally, we have developed design standards and control routines for efficient onsite installation and start up. Most of our customers can easily set up the systems themselves by following our manuals.  
As an option the systems can be delivered as a ready-to use container solution. This can be used to optimize logistics, minimize outage time and installation time.  
In a regular container solution the cooling system pump unit, treatment circuit, motor starters as well as the protection and system control are mounted into an enclosure or container. Optional equipment for the container may include insulation, ventilation, lighting, heating and air conditioning.

Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. 
Our RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.

Expert assessment and advanced algorithms are the foundation of informed decision-making. Hitachi Energy uses a reliability algorithm based on the Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA) method to assign a level of importance to each asset in the system. 
The impact can be calculated in terms of frequency and duration of interruptions, in terms of energy not supplied, or in financial terms in the form of loss of production, loss of revenue or penalties. Hitachi Energy experts help customers select the most appropriate solution in each situation. Based on the statistical contribution to the total loss of service or loss of revenue, the algorithm ranks substation assets from low to high importance. 
Using asset-specific checklists, a Hitachi Energy expert assesses the condition of assets and collects information about a substation’s operational experience. No outage is required, so operations are not affected. 
Advanced Hitachi Energy remote support solutions are available to support the on-site assessment remotely, or to reach in-house specialists for an in-depth analysis of critical assets. On top, the assessment can be combined with a 3D Scan to generate the foundation for a digital representation of the system. 
Combining the importance analysis with the results of a condition assessment, assets are placed in a risk matrix that illustrates the individual contribution of each one to overall risk. This helps to define recommendations that will give due priority to high risk equipment and achieve the most effective means of reducing system risk. 
Hitachi Energy will recommend interventions that are tailored to the calculated risks and needs. For example, a replacement/overhaul plan will improve the substation’s condition and reduce probability of failure; upgrading substation design and its redundancies will help reduce the negative impact of failures on operations.

The definition of contingency transformers and reactors may vary across customers, manufacturers, and even from one part of the world to another. 
These units are designed to bring rapid responses, improve power quality, or provide temporary power where and when it’s needed all across the globe. 
They are used during the following: 
• Planned maintenance
• Temporary substation capacity increase
• Forced outage repairs
• Weather and other natural outages
• Sabotage and attacks
• Spare or backup solutions 
Besides mobility, these units offer service providers time to make repairs and get service back on without interruption. For example, the mobile substation is useful when maintenance work is needed on substations. This keeps the consumer's power from being shut off during repairs. Their compact size also makes the units easier to use in small areas. Their flexibility allows them to be switched from one task to another relatively easily.

Mobile Transformers are fast-recovery, multi-voltage units that are available with Hitachi Energy’s “shell-type” technology that uses a patented unique configuration of the transformer’s active components. It enables an ultra-compact and durable solution ideal for emergencies and quick transport. 
These power transformers are often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Mobile Transformers are factory-built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil-filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours and can be detached from their moving base for extended or specific operations. 
Mobile Transformers can cover a broad range of emergency response scenarios. When installed on a trailer, the transformer can be shipped to different locations within 230kV and 345kV. 
Mobile Transformer 2 design options:
Same physics and functionality but different construction. 
These transformers are part of a mobile substation, including switchgear, breakers, control, and protection circuits. This mobile power station can be on location within 24 hours and provide temporary electrical power to the downed area. The units are designed for outdoor use, some having a long-life, durable coating. Their most significant advantage is the ability to move from one location to another quickly. 
Similar to our Mobile Transformer products, a Mobile Shunt Reactor is often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Since a shunt reactor is an absorber of reactive power, it will increase the energy efficiency of the system by also being the most compact device commonly used for reactive power compensation in long high-voltage transmission lines, which makes them ideally suited for mobile applications. 
Mobile Shunt Reactors are factory built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours, and they can also be detached from their moving base (semi-trailer, box truck, or sea-freight container) for operations.

The page with name "Oil Regeneration or Reclamation | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/parts-and-maintain/advanced-maintenance/oil-regeneration-reclamation" has the following content:
Oil ages during the operating life of a transformer. By performing oil reclamation, where the oil is passed through an absorbent, the oil can be reinserted into the transformer in a new state. 
Oil is a natural material that ages due to the operating environment and transformer properties. Through oil sampling and analysis, the condition of the oil can be inferred. Aged oil demonstrates a higher concentration of oxidation and acids.
 
Oil reclamation or oil regeneration is a process whereby oil is processed to achieve a significant condition improvement, aimed at being as close to “as new” as possible, by removing the aging products. The processing is performed while a transformer is in service to achieve maximum effectiveness with minimum impact on on-site operations. The oil affects the insulation in the transformer, and the insulation affects the oil; hence the condition of the oil impacts the expected life of the transformer.
 
For some transformers, there is data available for up to 10 years after reclamation. The data shows very little change in acidity and color after 10 years of operation since the oil was reclaimed.
 
To prevent excessive production of acids due to oil degradation, it is recommended that the oil be reclaimed before it is severely degraded. Low molecular weight acids migrate into the paper insulation and become much harder to remove than from the oil.
 
The essential elements of the online reclamation technology are that the absorbent is automatically reactivated after each cycle and that the transformer remains in operation. The reactivation allows for using much more active absorbent than with the classical type of reclaiming plants, where the Fullers' earth needs to be replaced frequently and thereafter disposed of. The final step is to restore the inhibitor content.

Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. 
Our RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.

The page with name "Transformer Component Upgrades | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade" has the following content:
The main concern in aging and the life expectancy of transformers is the condition of the insulation system and key components of the transformer, like the bushing, tap changer, and cooling equipment. 
The insulation system, a combination of mineral oil and paper in a transformer, degrades over time, and finally, they lose the capability to withstand the stresses a transformer might see in daily life (short circuits, energizing, vibration, etc.). The lifetime of these organic products in a transformer depends on the insulation's operating temperature, oxygen content, oil acidity, and moisture content.  
It is possible to reverse the aging of mineral oil through oil reclamation that can restore the material properties close to the values when new. The aging of paper insulation, however, is an irreversible process and is considered one of the life-limiting processes of a transformer. 
Temperature is mainly dependent on the transformer design, the loading, the cooling facilities, and the ambient temperature.  Cooling overhaul or upgrade is a highly recommended solution for operating the transformer at a lower temperature or for power upgrade purposes. Moreover, this alternative has significant cost savings versus new transformer replacement.  
Bushings are key components in the transformer. Thermal and electrical stress, ambient conditions, and more put high demands on bushings resulting in failures originating in the bushings, most often leading to severe consequences such as fires and explosions. Condition assessment and replacement of bushings by the latest state-of-the-art technology reduce the risk of transformer failures. 
On the other hand, Tap-changers cause concern due to their service needs and failure probability, but with appropriate service and certified technicians, this probability can be dramatically reduced. As the OEM of transformers and tap-changers, our global team of experts and certified technicians stand ready to provide support 24/7. Always maintain the highest quality of service with original spare parts, the latest training, and the possibility of upgrading your OLTC. 
To extend the life of your assets, Hitachi Energy provides preventive (eventually curative) actions to be performed on-site, aiming to maintain the performance of the transformer for which specific equipment and a higher degree of expertise are required. It is usually linked with diagnosis tests, engineering, and life cycle assessment to clearly determine the most appropriate route of action and ensure condition-based maintenance.

The page with name "Thyristor controlled series compensation | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/thyristor-controlled-series-compensation" has the following content:
Series Compensation with Thyristor Control (TCSC) enables rapid dynamic modulation of the inserted reactance. At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way. 
The TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.
 
Thyristor controlled series compensation principle
There are two main principles supporting TCSC technology. 
The TCSC achieves both objectives by using control algorithms that work concurrently. The controls will function on the thyristor circuit (this in parallel to the main capacitor bank) such that controlled charges are added to the main capacitor, making it a variable capacitor at fundamental frequency but a "virtual inductor" at subsynchronous frequencies. 
Thyristor controlled series compensation technology
From a principal technology point of view, the TCSC resembles the conventional series capacitor. The power equipment is located on an isolated steel platform, including the thyristor valve used to control the inductor in parallel with the capacitor bank. The inductor is placed on support insulators outside the platform. Control and protection systems are located on ground potential, together with other auxiliary systems.

The page with name "MACH™ control and protection system | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/hvdc/mach-control-and-protection-system" has the following content:
The Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) control system provides unequalled calculation capacity and enables a high degree of integration and handling for all control and protection functions. Moreover,
 
Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) control provides advanced fault registration and remote control functions. The system is designed to run 24/7 for thirty years or more, allowing the HVDC system to be controlled and protected in the most reliable way throughout its life time. 
To fulfill current and future requirements Hitachi Energy has developed the Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) system as a fully computerized one, using state-of-the-art computers, microcontrollers and digital signal processors connected by high-performance industrial standard buses and fiber optic communication links. Because of the extensive use of computers and micro-controllers, it has been possible to include very powerful internal supervision, which eliminates periodic maintenance of the control equipment. 
The system consists of the station control and monitoring servers, operator workstations, control and protection main computers, digital signal processor units, I/O systems and valve control units. Thanks to the modularity and high performance of the MACH equipment, the type of hardware and system software used for a VSC-HVDC  control system are the same as in an LCC-HVDC or a FACTS control system. In fact, only the application software and the valve control differs. 
The ability to upgrade is yet another advantage with Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™). That means even an older HVDC system can enjoy the benefits of great controllability. This is a great way to prolong the lifetime of an existing transmission link with rapid project completion and minimal transmission disruption.

The page with name "Inspection and diagnostics | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/inspection-and-diagnostics" has the following content:
The three main factors which can affect the health of the transformers are paper, which is used for conductor insulation; the pressboard, which is used for the major insulation and winding support; and the insulating oil. 
With age, water and contaminants (air or gas bubbles, particles of different origins, oxygen, and oil aging) dissolve in the dielectric fluid of the transformer, increasing the risk of failures or accelerating aging of the insulation system, thus reducing the technical life. The level of possible contamination of the insulating oil over the years depends on its design, especially on the effectiveness of the oil preservation system and sources of contamination.
 
By sampling and analyzing the dielectric fluid, contaminants can be detected, and appropriate preventative actions initiated. The Oil and Gas Analysis remains a critical component of the condition assessment of the transformer. 
Using our global reach, we support many customers worldwide in the collection of oil samples, the oil and gas analysis in our certified oil laboratories, as well as providing a first analysis of the unit's health status. Combining this with our extensive design knowledge as well as repair/refurbishment know-how accumulated over the years, we can present a more comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations to prolong the usage of the transformer. 
Online oil regeneration has technical and economic advantages when applied to old transformers with aged, acidic oil. The process is more environmentally friendly than oil replacement and demonstrates much better efficiency over the long term. This is a very efficient alternative to passivation since it enables the definitive removal of corrosive compounds from corrosive oils, thus avoiding the risk of copper sulfide formation.

Realizing the benefits of an advanced power system management requires the automation of local operations, and the collection, evaluation, and forwarding of data on the power system status and plant condition to higher-level systems. The SAS600 station level solutions provide remote control and monitoring functions for all kinds of substations from distribution level to extra-high-voltage substations. 
Station Level Solutions provide a central database, HMI, and gateway functionality at the substation level. The substation communication networks are part of the solution. It inter-connects and integrates the bay level intelligent electronic devices (bay control and protection devices) using the well-proven IEC 61850 standard. They are easy to use and to adapt to customer-specific requirements. 
Power transmission substations are very often unmanned and can be physically distributed over quite a large area. They usually not only contain the high voltage level but also the sub-transmission and distribution as well. It is essential to have a common substation automation system for all voltage level that can provide reliable remote connection for operational purposes and to have a fast and secure remote access to data for incident analysis. 
Industrial customers have typically to cope with distribution substations spread over the entire area of a factory or a section of it. Transmission substations connecting the factories distribution network with the power grid may also be in the scope. Comprehensive solutions at the substation level is the key for reliable automation as well as local and remote control.

The page with name "STATCOM - Hybrid | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/statcom/statcom-hybrid" has the following content:

With high power semiconductors becoming commercially available, STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) technology began being deployed in the late 1990s. Hitachi Energy STATCOM, under the brand name of SVC Light®, is based on chain-link modular multilevel (MMC) voltage source converters (VSC), particularly adapted for power system applications. It is capable of providing high reactive power in grids more or less unimpeded by suppressed voltages, and with a high dynamic response. Further development has combined VSC technology with that of thyristor-based SVC (Static Var Compensator), combining the best of both technologies and offering joint benefits by incorporating Thyristor Switched Capacitors (TSC) and Thyristor-Switched Reactors (TSR) to create a Hybrid STATCOM solution. 
In general, STATCOM comes into the picture where available space in substations is scarce, the reactive power output needs to be controllable more or less independent of the AC system voltage, or a speed of response is desired one order of magnitude greater than what is possible with thyristors. Also, VSC based solutions are less sensitive and dependent on network conditions. Harmonic filters in classic SVCs are a weak point, as their performance depends entirely on the harmonic impedance of the network.
 
STATCOM in itself provides a symmetrical operating range. For asymmetrical operation and in order to optimize performance, Hybrid STATCOM may be the best solution, in particular for very large Mvar operation ranges.  In these cases, the STATCOM power can be supplemented by thyristor switched branches to attain the desired Mvar output. TSR (Thyristor Switched Reactor) provides extension of the inductive range, whereas TSC (Thyristor Switched Capacitor) provides extension of the capacitive range of the device. By means of fast switched thyristor valves in joint operation with the VSC, TSR and TSC enable rapid, repeated and transient free switching of reactive elements (reactors and capacitors).    
Multilevel VSC based STATCOM has low harmonic generation. As neither TSC nor TSR add any harmonics to the picture, Hybrid STATCOM has low harmonic generation, too. As a benefit, no low order harmonic filters are required in the installation. 
STATCOM as well as Hybrid STATCOM for power transmission applications normally make use of a power transformer between the grid and the medium voltage busbar. On this bus the VSC is connected in series with a coupling reactor. In addition, in the Hybrid case, TSR and TSC are added in parallel.

The page with name "City center infeed | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc/city-center-infeed" has the following content:
Power loads in cities are increasing as the world urbanizes, and metropolitan power networks are continuously upgrading in order to meet the demand for power. Land space being scarce and expensive, substantial difficulties arise whenever new right-of-way must be secured to carry additional power over traditional transmission lines.
 
As power transmission levels increase, the risk of exceeding the short-circuit capability of existing switchgear equipment as well as other network components becomes another real threat to the further expansion of power networks. Strategies to develop urban power networks must also address issues like power congestion, pollution, acoustical and electrical noise, power quality and control, and permits, among others. 
With HVDC technology all the above issues are solved. The HVDC Light converter stations are compact and by virtue of their control, they do not contribute to the short-circuit levels. The controls can balance power flow on multiple urban infeeds. The DC cables are easily installed underground using existing right-of-ways and the capacity can thus be increased on existing power corridors.

Modern electrical equipment imposes stringent demands on voltage stability and power quality. 
The power network can tolerate only a limited level of harmonics and other electrical disturbances. By installing passive harmonic filters in medium/high-voltage networks, several benefits can be obtained: 
A “clean” network creates much less strain on equipment and lengthens its life span. This results in a lower maintenance cost and the cost for replacing worn-out equipment. 
Hitachi Energy passive harmonic filters are the ideal solution to render medium/high-voltage networks more efficient and trouble-free. 
Any small and large medium/high-voltage utility, and industrial installations where harmonics need to be filtered.

The page with name "Offshore wind connections | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc/offshore-wind-connections" has the following content:
In many countries the best onshore locations for wind farms are already developed, and the utilities are turning to offshore sites. The main attraction of going offshore is the enormous wind resource available. Average wind speeds can be 20 percent higher, and the resulting energy yield up to 70 percent greater than on land. The lack of obstacles such as hills, and the generally smooth surface of the sea, also makes the wind more reliable.
 
With more and larger wind parks set to be built offshore, major investments are needed to find ways to feed the power into the grid. The alternating current technology used in the first, smaller offshore wind parks is increasingly reaching its limits on account of the high reactive power demand of the cables. For wind farms distant to the coast, HVDC Light is the ideal means to bring the power to shore and to assure a good power quality. 
The HVDC Light converter stations have a small station footprint and low weight - a fact that is of particular importance in the offshore station. 
The on-shore (receiving) converter station can be located close to the shore or further inland. The grid is sometimes rather weak (radial structure) along the coastline, but this may not necessarily be a problem, since HVDC Light can be connected to weak points. But it is also easy to bring the connection point to a major substation at some distance from the shore by means of the HVDC Light cables. 
The newest example of a HVDC Light wind farm transmission offshore is the 1200 MW Dogger Bank. 
Dogger Bank Wind Farm will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm when completed in 2026.

In a fast-changing environment, asset managers need to keep up with past challenges to produce, transmit, distribute, and deliver electrical power in a reliable way. Aging assets, rising energy demand, and the need to deliver without unplanned outages are some of the challenges utilities and industries are facing today around the world. 
Fixing these challenges means that new solutions are needed to maintain the installed base of assets as well as when refurbishing, repairing, or upgrading legacy transformers. Since the late 90s, Hitachi Energy has offered a modular three-step approach to a Condition-Based Maintenance or Reliability Centered Maintenance program:
 
Step 1. Fleet screening survey: A quick scan of a large population (20 to 200 units) collects easily accessible data, such as unit nameplate data, oil and dissolved-gas-in-oil data, load profile, history of the unit, and sister units.
 
Step 2. Condition assessment: At this stage, transformer design experts focus on a smaller number of units (10 to 20) identified in step 1. They use modern design rules and tools to evaluate the original design. Advanced diagnostic tests are performed to assess each of the principal properties of the transformer in a structured way. This assessment leads to an estimate of each transformer`s risk of failure and defines action plans to improve the reliability of each unit. 
Step 3. Expertise: The number of units to be further analyzed is typically limited to two or three out of a population of 100 units. This third module of the assessment process provides accurate information with respect to overloading transformers, enhancing their performance (power or voltage increase), or extending their lifetime. 
Our service offerings assess the operational condition of transformers, provide recommendations to mitigate risks, and enhance the performance of aged equipment to meet possible new requirements. It also provides state-of-the-art information on online monitoring solutions, maintenance, and repair options to be used to ensure reliable operating conditions. 
It is three steps approach that can be applied to a single or fleet of transformers. The steps include fleet screening, design and condition assessment, and life assessment /profiling of the transformer fleet. The reports provide each transformer's condition and life assessment with recommendations for further action in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of failures.

The page with name "Bushing Replacements | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade/bushing-replacements" has the following content:
High-voltage bushings are critical components whose failure can have serious consequences. 
Thermal and electrical stress, ambient conditions, and more are putting high demand on bushings. Because of the high electrical stress levels in bushings, failures in oil-impregnated bushings with porcelain insulators tend to result in sudden and catastrophic failure of an explosive nature. 
Condition assessment and replacement of defect bushings, therefore, drastically reduce the risk of transformer failures. Certain types and applications may have a higher risk which is yet another reason for condition assessment. Knowing the health of your bushings allows you to take planned precautionary actions in time, be it in maintenance or replacement – all with the purpose of keeping your transformer reliable and online, supporting your network. 
Little maintenance is required other than checking the oil level (if applicable), power factor and capacitance testing, and checking the condition of the top terminals. Bushings exposed to salt spray, concrete dust, and other abnormal deposits are subject to a special hazard and must be cleaned regularly to prevent flashover and corrosion of parts. 
Oil-filled bushings may be considered for exchange to dry-type with composite insulators to reduce the consequences of failures and the need for maintenance. Repair of high-voltage condenser bushings is normally not economically justifiable. However, exceptions exist.

The page with name "Back to back | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc/back-to-back" has the following content:

An HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.  
An HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks. There are several back-to-back stations in operation in the world. In these installations both the rectifier and the inverter are located in the same station and are normally used in order to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks, which could have the same or different frequencies. Another benefit is using a back-to-back for splitting up a too strong network to reduce short circuit current.  
The direct voltage level can be selected without consideration of the optimum values for an overhead line and a cable and is therefore normally quite low, 150 kilovolts (kV) or lower. The only major equipment on the DC side is a smoothing reactor.

The digital substation components allow interfacing with all old and new technologies. To interface with existing equipment, we offer standalone merging units and breaker intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) (SAM600 I/O system). 
In general, digital technology will reduce testing in the future, as all systems will become supervised and will allow you to shift from fixed, time-based to condition- or risk-based maintenance schemes. Specifically testing the digital substation provides a safer testing behavior that reduces the effort for disconnection voltage and current circuits. 
The digital substation has different entry points, making it easy for you to get started with the application and amount of technology that best fit your organization’s current needs and level of maturity. For example, you can begin with monitoring or communications to test how it benefits you in the short term. Once you’ve undertaken this step, the next step could be to translate this learning to the network or enterprise level. In short, you do not necessarily have to begin with an entire digital substation and instead can start with a test concept. Hitachi Energy has a long history of successfully delivering digital substation projects, having worked on more than 50 digital substations, and we are perfectly positioned to guide you through the project based on your pace and specific organizational needs. 
Digital technology improves safety because there are fewer signal connections or inadvertently opened CT circuits that could harm personnel during commissioning and service activities.  
Digital substations reduce your carbon footprint because they require less space for protection and control panels. Also, functions that were previously executed by physically separate equipment can be integrated into one device.

 
Achieve higher productivity with new asset management systems that include monitoring and diagnostics data from substation equipment. This added insight substantially improves the efficiency of service activities. Monitoring and diagnostics are strategic features for utilities, further reducing outage time and increasing reliability.

 
Take the lead in the digitalization of your grid, ensure longer lifecycle of your assets, and ensure a more secure communication environment with IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 Hitachi Energy certified products and tools.  Hitachi Energy’s SAM600 and PCM600 are designed and certified to comply to the latest IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 standard, enabling interoperability and reliable communication between digital assets even in complex systems. 
Since its publication in 2004, the global IEC 61850 standard has been accepted at a remarkably fast rate. Developed with the support of Hitachi Energy, it is the first truly global standard in the electric utility field.

The evolution hasn't stopped there. Since the advent of the IEC 61850 edition 2 in 2011, which takes the standard outside of the substation, Hitachi Energy invested tremendous efforts in implementing this standard in our systems, tools, and products. We believe IEC 61850 is the basis for a successful and modern digital grid. 
The defining feature of a digital substation is the implementation of a process bus. The introduction of IEC 61850 in 2005 was a key enabler for digitization and digitalization of power systems everywhere. The various technological advances spurred by IEC 61850 raised customer expectations about the quality and reliability of power supply. The IEC 61850 process bus enables the substitution of point-to-point copper connections between IEDs and other devices (e.g., instruments transformers, gas monitoring, etc.) with a safe and standardized optical communication bus.  
Hitachi Energy has a longstanding experience in digital substations, placing it at the market forefront of this technology innovation, ensuring compliance with the highest standards in the industry.
 
Retrofitting is a vital and natural next step to extend the service life of your substation, helping to lower capital expenditure and increase network reliability. 
Retrofit scenarios are pivotal for substations, as the lifecycle of secondary equipment is typically half that of primary devices. 
However, retrofit projects are, by their nature, more challenging than new projects. This is because of compatibility challenges between the old and new devices, which, in turn, could cause operational disruptions during commissioning. 
There are many directions you can take to install or upgrade a substation, depending on needs and budget. Therefore, it is important to choose a strategic partner who is an expert in the field to ensure the smooth installation and functioning of your new or retrofitted substations.

Based on many years of experience in complex installations, Hitachi Energy offers services to evolve or upgrade the installation to the next generation, extend system lifetime, and improve availability and reliability. 
Upgrades
Proactively upgrading a system before a severe outage occurs can save time and money. The need for upgrading depends mainly on age, the general condition of the equipment, and the potential unavailability of spare parts. 
Modernizing an HVDC installation has been shown to extend system lifetime, improve availability and reliability, increase cost efficiency, improve performance, increase the capacity, and increase the power rating of the link.
 
HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations. 
HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used. 
Electricity is converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa in a converter station. This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves. 
Hitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world. 
The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.

The page with name "EconiQ retrofill for gas-insulated lines ELK-3, 420 kV | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/econiq-eco-efficient-hv-portfolio/econiq-retrofill-gil-elk-3-420kv" has the following content:
The innovative EconiQ retrofill solution uses eco-efficient fluoronitrile based gas mixture to replace SF6 in installed gas-insulated lines. This can be done with minimum changes to existing equipment while ensuring performance of the equipment and significantly lowering environmental impact.
 
In this process, SF6 from the installed gas-insulated lines is evacuated and filled into gas bottles for recycling or disposal and the GIL is then flushed to remove any humidity. The new eco-efficient gas mixture is then filled into the GIL and the switchgear is re-energized to connect back to the grid. The process is relatively quick and enables the reuse of passive gas components designed for SF6 to be converted into non-SF6 equipment, thereby improving their environmental and lifecycle performance. 
EconiQ is Hitachi Energy's eco-efficient portfolio for sustainability where products, services and solutions are proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance.

The page with name "Static Var compensation (SVC) | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/static-var-compensation-svc" has the following content:
Static Var Compensators (SVCs) are devices that can quickly and reliably control line voltages. An SVC will typically regulate and control the voltage to the required set point under normal steady state and contingency conditions and thereby provide dynamic, fast response reactive power following system contingencies (e.g. network short circuits, line and generator disconnections). In addition, an SVC can also increase transfer capability, reduce losses, mitigate active power oscillations and prevent over voltages at loss of load. 
The Static Var Compensators (SVCs) is customized to fit each customer with their specific needs. The SVC consists of a number of fixed or switched branches, of which at least one branch includes thyristors, and the combination of branches can be varied a lot depending on requirements. An SVC typically includes a combination of at least two of the given items below (e.g. TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC): 
Most common topologies for Static Var Compensators are: TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC. The main advantage for using a topology with TSC branch(es) is to reduce the losses (by reducing the filter size). Hitachi Energy's SVC control system can be utilized for controlling new or existing external shunt banks.

The page with name "DC Traction Power Supply | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/railway-traction-power-supply/dc-traction-power-supply" has the following content:
Standardized traction voltages are 750 V DC, 1500 V DC and 3000 V DC. 

The three-phase voltage from the local utility is stepped down and rectified in the traction substations to provide the required DC voltage. 

Hitachi Energy portfolio covers the complete scope starting from the optimized grid connection down to the conductor rail or overhead line:  
Special emphasis is placed on  optimizing the footprint of the substations. Hitachi Energy addresses this requirement with pre-fabricated steel frame (container) buildings or off-the-shelf concrete buildings, allowing for a compact design and a high degree of integration. These pre-fabricated and transportable substations contain all main equipment, station auxiliaries  and the station control system.

The page with name "TXpand™ | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/power-transformers/txpand" has the following content:
Standard transformers are extremely rigid and strong structures, but when extreme pressure builds up due to internal failures, transformers can very rarely rupture, creating safety and environmental hazards. 
Like crumple zones in modern cars, which protect passengers by absorbing the energy during a crash for controlled damage, increased flexibility can provide the solution.
 
TXpand™ is a new power transformer technology for rupture resistance, enhancing safety for people and the environment. Transformers containing this technology can literally expand, absorbing energy from faults.
 
Hitachi Energy has developed the TXpand™ technology through careful analysis and modeling to make the most rigid areas flexible, the weakest points stronger, and integrating rupture points to take control of the most unpredictable failures. 
The TXpand™ solution has been demonstrated as capable of absorbing the expansion caused by a simulated 20 megajoule fault. Containing the energy safely, reducing risk and increasing safety for people in and around power substations. 
The features of TXpand™ design mitigate the consequences of even catastrophic failures. 
In tests simulating a very large and impossible contain, 66 megajoule fault the TXpand™ demonstrated that the rupture can be controlled; minimizing any oil spilled and predictably channeling what little oil escapes for more easy containment. 
More control and easier containment not only protect people in the area but also protect other valuable assets in a substation. 
By preventing damage to other substation equipment, the risk of power failure is reduced, and maintenance or replacement of this equipment is minimized.

The page with name "Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)  | Hitachi Energy" and URL "https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/modular-switchgear-monitoring-msm" has the following content:
Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) is used to supervise, manage and analyze performance of all type of high-voltage switchgear in new installations as well as a retrofit solution in existing high-voltage assets. The system operates independently of existing control and protection devices and can be installed in new substations or retrofitted in existing installations. By continuously monitoring critical parameters, MSM provides the base layer for a predictive maintenance strategy for the installation.The system is compliant with IEC 61850 and DNP 3.0 and it is provided with a web interface where all monitored data are accessible. 
Applications
 
Based on the monitoring application, MSM is offered in 2 versions with additional options: 
Why Hitachi Energy?
   
SF6 moisture 
Highly stable SF6 and gas density sensors are used to continuously monitor the integrity of the gas compartments and identify gas losses at an early stage. Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.

Benefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications: 
MSM gas monitoring feature is compatible with EconiQTM portfolio and other gas mixtures. 
Non-invasive hall sensors and signals from auxiliary switches are used to monitor key parameters of the circuit breaker. Measured signals include phase current during operation, trip and close coil current, and motor current. Monitored parameters are categorized in mechanical performance, wear, as well as accessories. Measured curves are stored as comtrade files on the system, allowing further analysis. 

All features of MSM-I are included in this application as well.

Benefits of MSM-II for circuit-breaker applications:
 
Humidity Monitoring 
High levels of humidity in SF6 impact its dielectric withstand (the condensation of water on the surface of insulators will lead to significant reduction of dielectric strength and flashover) and on the formation of corrosive and toxic decomposition products. It is important to control humidity during initial manufacture, assemble, commissioning and over the lifetime of the equipment. 
Continuous humidity monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. 
Correct heater operation in drives, cubicles, etc. is crucial for reliable operation of circuit breakers. 
Monitoring of heaters is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II
 

Disconnector and earthing switch monitoring
 
Disconnector and earthing switches are critical live components of high-voltage switchgears. Disconnector monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II 

Internal arc localization
 
Detect an internal fault arc and localize the gas compartment where it occurs is important since the event has a possible impact on gas dielectric withstand. 
MSM allows to reduce the effort to determine the fault location by gas pressure analysis, automatically identifying the gas compartment where an arc occurs.  
Internal arc localization is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. 

Travel curve monitoring with measured travel curve
 
Mechanical performance of switchgear depends on the travel characteristic of the closing and open operations. 
MSM-II can simulate travel curve but if accurate travel curve measure is needed, the travel curve monitoring with measured travel curve option can be installed. 
MSM provides:

Through continuous investments in Research & Development, Hitachi Energy became the inventor of the paperless, Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) bushing technology. In our flagship RIS line EasyDry®, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.
 
Hitachi Energy’s paperless RIS bushings are made of a synthetic non-woven material that is wound around a conductor with aluminum foil inserts for electrical stress control. The core is afterward vacuum-impregnated with epoxy resin and cured, giving a partial discharge-free dry bushing. 
This paperless bushing technology has an advanced insulation performance due to its non-hygroscopic insulation that is not sensitive to moisture ingress and absorption. In addition, RIS bushings will have a superior effect on the power factor (dielectric losses), and the intrinsic aging behavior leading to an extended product lifetime.

Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. 
Our RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.

If the traction transformer fails, the planned train traffic schedule may be disturbed and leads to passenger inconvenience, and even costly penalties may be incurred. 
A traction transformer is highly reliable and designed to perform under harsh conditions. However, to prevent unpredicted failure and ensure a long lifetime, some services are advised during the whole life cycle. 
The operating conditions of a traction transformer differ highly from power transformers. Therefore the interpretation of condition checks has to be done by traction experts; otherwise, misleading results may occur. 
Regular oil analysis gives a good image of the actual health. Additionally, basic and advanced diagnostic tests can provide further information. 
If an onboard traction transformer gets damaged by an accident or due to other reasons, we are able to fully repair the traction transformer by replacing damaged parts of the core, winding reclamping, partial or full winding replacement, and repair of the tank. At the end of such work, all electrical routine tests are done. 
During the long lifetime of a vehicle, some operational conditions change. Upgrading or replacing some parts of the traction transformer can help ensure further operation. 
A midlife overhaul is recommended to ensure reliability in the second half of the lifetime. All traction transformers are systematically checked and maintained by replacing parts with lower lifetime expectancy.

Hitachi Energy's cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. Hitachi Energy offers a complete pure cooling system portfolio for industrial and power transmission applications with cooling capacity from 2 kW to several megawatts. 
Hitachi Energy's pure water cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. The cooling media in our solutions is water. The specific application determines when to use tap water, glycol water, or pure water. 
Our cooling system solutions are available for every stage of the product life cycle from development, design, sales and production, to assembly, testing, installation, commissioning, training and service. 
Our cooling media is water. The quality of water needed is determined by the specific application:  
Pure water - when water with low conductivity is needed 
Power electronic applications such as: 
Tap water - when conductivity is no issue 
Applications include 
Glycol/water mixture - when there is a risk for freezing 
The principle of all pure-water cooling systems is fundamentally the same. There is a main loop cooling the object. Water transfers the heat to water-to-water or water-to-air heat exchangers. From the main loop a small part of the flow passes a water-processing circuit. The water is filtered mechanically. If necessary, it is also continuously purified from ions and oxygen. The conductivity of the cooling water can be maintained as low as <0.1µS/cm (at 25°C). 
Our cooling systems are prefabricated and assembled in one or several units. Most of the systems include control equipment with PLC and software. The systems are tested and verified before delivery. 
As we deliver systems globally, we have developed design standards and control routines for efficient onsite installation and start up. Most of our customers can easily set up the systems themselves by following our manuals.  
As an option the systems can be delivered as a ready-to use container solution. This can be used to optimize logistics, minimize outage time and installation time.  
In a regular container solution the cooling system pump unit, treatment circuit, motor starters as well as the protection and system control are mounted into an enclosure or container. Optional equipment for the container may include insulation, ventilation, lighting, heating and air conditioning.

This underlines the importance of assessing both the moisture and temperature of the insulation system. Temperature and vacuum are the main factors for drying speed and drying quality. 
For optimized drying, the transformer should be heated at the same time as the vacuum is applied (as is done during the vapor phase process). With the combination of the low-frequency heating (LFH) technique and hot oil spray or hot oil circulation, this can also be achieved on-site.
 
The low-frequency voltage is necessary in order to reduce the applied voltage on the transformer when it is under vacuum. The reason is that the breakdown voltage of the insulation system is much lower under vacuum than under atmospheric pressure. This is also known as Paschen's law.
 
In order to prevent hotspots during drying (due to reduced cooling), the applied current for heating power transformers should not exceed 50% of the nominal current. Consequently, the copper losses will be no more than Ľ of the nominal losses, and the risk of potential hot spots at points with higher resistance will be negligible. 
In order to heat up both the low and high-voltage windings, a frequency of approximately 1 Hz is applied to the transformer.
 
The transformer can be heated uniformly with the combination of LFH drying and the conventional hot oil spray method. The LFH system heats the windings from the inside, and the hot oil spray supports the heating process by heating the outer parts of the insulation system.

Build, operate and maintain HVDC converter stations with sustainability in mind 
Learn how the HVDC technology makes it possible to increase integration of offshore wind power generation into the grid and accelerates green energy transition in Europe. 
Learn how Hitachi Energy has embraced the challenge and opportunity to realized Combined Grid Solutions, a case that could become more and more common in the years to come. 
Learn how the HVDC technology from Hitachi Energy makes it possible to increase stability and controllability of the grid and retain power transmission in the network. 
High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is a key enabler for a carbon-neutral energy system. It is highly efficient for transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances, integration of renewables and interconnecting grids, opening up for new sustainable transmission solutions. 
HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations. 
HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used. 
Hitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world. 
The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability. 
IdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time. 
An HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks. 
Cables and small converter stations - HVDC has great potential for city applications. 
HVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day. 
Avoid using expensive fuel in small uneconomic plants - make an HVDC connection to a larger grid. 
DC technology provides a more secure and optimized control of a network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout. 
Being proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown. 
In many regions of the world, liberalized energy markets have introduced the phenomenon of trading to electricity sectors and trading is enabled by coupling electricity markets with network interconnections. 
Hitachi Energy's technology for the offshore wind power industry is essential in the transmission of high quality power with minimal loss. 
Many classical HVDC systems use overhead transmission lines. In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations. 
HVDC Light® can be used to deliver power both to and from offshore platforms.

From high-speed trains that improve intercity connections to light rail, metro systems, trams, and eBus networks that alleviate congestion, reduce emissions, and improve quality of life, the world is moving toward a new era of mobility. 
These days most offices grind to a halt in the face of a failed internet connection, but this isn't comparable to the failure of the telecommunication system that underpins regular and resilient transportation operations. 
The digitalization of the industry relies on a robust, reliable, and predictable communication network, which is sometimes called the third utility, water, and power is the first and second. It is also foundational to Industry 4.0. Only industrial suppliers with an intimate knowledge of the transportation industry can supply, and maintain, communications equipment capable of meeting that unique set of demands including the system life cycle requirements of a rail asset. 
Hitachi Energy’s wired and wireless communications portfolio offers long-lasting support for transportation specific OT applications, while also delivering on the requirements of digital railways and urban transport networks of the future. 
Deployed in the Arabian Desert and Siberia, our mission-critical communications equipment for transportation providers are also exposed to strong EMF (electromagnetic fields) coming from the electrical traction supply system. Furthermore, the environment may be dusty or located in tunnels with challenging access for preventive maintenance, therefore fans may not be desirable. In order to maintain the high levels of availability required, especially in emergency situations, mission-critical communications equipment must offer a robust and reliable design that has proven capabilities for providing accurate functionality under extreme conditions. 
Urban rail transport safety, reliability, and efficiency critically rely on communication systems to face growing challenges, including dense traffic and complexity of networks, automation, and integration with other networks. 
Most large and even small cities around the world are building or expanding their urban Rail (metros and suburban), as part of large-scale environment-friendly mass mobility transformation. Hitachi Energy Mission-critical communication systems is helping municipalities and cities around the globe in this environmentally responsible smart city transformation. 
Hitachi Energy mission-critical communications solutions for rail and urban transportation connect your asset-based operations and ensure a high-resolution perspective of your networks and operations for revolutionary efficiencies
 
Railway signaling (ETCS and other)
The European Train Control System (ETCS) is the signaling and control component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). It is a replacement for legacy train protection systems and designed to replace the many incompatible safety systems currently used by European railways. The standard is also adopted outside Europe and is an option for worldwide applications. 
GSM-R
GSM-R, Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway is an international wireless communications standard for railway communication and applications. A sub-system of ERTMS, it is used for communication between train and railway regulation control centers. 
Railway operational telephony
In order to operate, Railways use fixed telephony with many different types of users. The station master will need one or more lines to manage the operation of the station. The power dispatcher (controlling the high voltage power on the line) needs to be able to talk with the substations. Most railways also have trackside telephones that are used by track workers or train drivers in case of emergency. There will also be telephone services offered to the general public, e.g. an emergency phone on a station platform or in a tunnel. 
Customer service applications
With the pressing need for railways to be ever more customer-centric, ticketing systems, various visual and audio customer information systems, as well as Internet access for passengers in stations, are very important and visible services that the network needs to deliver. 
SCADA data for traction power
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) monitor and control the Traction Power distribution, with a number of Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and/or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) trackside and operator terminals at the Control Center. SCADA Systems achieve protection and automation of power supply, acquisition, and storage of parameters of power supply, monitoring and controlling the entire power supply system, alarm and logging system, load management, load shedding, power quality monitoring, and management. There is also a separate SCADA system to control station automation. 
CCTV, access and perimeter control
Across rail networks, security has become a more pressing issue. The trend is towards a digital infrastructure for physical security applications, allowing us to take one camera and view it in one or 100 positions without affecting the quality of the video stream. This allows railways to distribute the management of control operational centers and create buddy systems, back-up control rooms and extra viewing positions by using digital network infrastructure. This also paves the way for video analytics. In the past, there would have been numerous separate access control, video surveillance, and intercom systems, but now they tend to be managed as single security systems through the use of hypervisors. 
Wireless connectivity for rail staff and asset monitoring
Wireless connectivity in stations and train yards makes business support systems always available and optimize staff workload. With the digitalization of more and more systems, reliable connectivity is a crucial enabler for an efficient asset management policy. Hitachi Energy Wireless solutions provide that extra connectivity layer.  
Hitachi Energy is enabling industrial-strength mission-critical communications network solutions, building reliable, secure, manageable, and scalable foundations that provide performance for Intelligent Transport Systems. 
Intelligent Transport Systems are entirely reliant on good communications; to know where vehicles comprising the network are, but also to monitor the equipment keeping the network moving. If you add the digitalization of much more equipment it can generate huge quantities of data at a high velocity, which must be transported over a robust communications network. That network needs punctuality when the situation demands it, and redundancy to maintain connectivity in the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is an umbrella term for a wide range of solutions that provide benefits to mass transit systems including buses. ITS applications for mass transit include transit signal priority, automated vehicle location, computer-aided dispatch, telemetry as well as passengers’ infotainment. 
Mission-critical networks are foundational, enabling ITS applications by providing two-way communication between sensors, controllers and people in the field, and software and supervisory personnel in the operations center. Communication technologies also facilitate interaction among drivers, dispatchers, emergency responders, and other personnel involved in transit and transportation operations. Those networks cover the following characteristics:

Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. 
Our RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.
