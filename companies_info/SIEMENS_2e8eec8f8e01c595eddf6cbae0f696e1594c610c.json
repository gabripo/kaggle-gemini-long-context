        "We offer a wide range of pipeline compressors with a choice of axial intake or conventional horizontally opposed suction and discharge nozzles. All designs allow for easy access to compressor internals without the need to remove piping.  With up to 91% polytropic efficiency, our pipeline compressors are second to none in the industry. Each compressor’s aerodynamic assembly is custom engineered to maximize efficiency and operating range.",
        "Our pipeline compressors are typically packaged with the driver and all auxiliary systems on a base frame for ease of handling and reduced site installation time. A comprehensive range of industrial and aeroderivative gas turbines from are available as drivers. Fixed and variable speed electric drive systems can be alternatively offered as prime movers.",
        "Gas turbines Aeroderivative, industrial and heavy-duty gas turbines up to 65MW",
        "Electric motor drives High voltage motors are available in virtually any imaginable configuration and offer power ranges up to 100MW and higher",
        "Variable frequency drives We have chosen a range of drives to meet your specific needs with the optimal solution for every type of medium voltage application.",
        "We also provide custom designed compressors covering special performance requirements outside the above ranges such as those frequently required for compressor head stations and natural gas storage and withdrawal operations.",
        "We provide full installation and commissioning services, as well as comprehensive service support over the lifetime of your equipment, including routine maintenance and repair services, upgrades and retrofits, and condition monitoring. These services can be either provided on demand or as part of long-term service agreements. With our global network of service centers, experienced field service representatives and OEM spare parts we want to ensure that our customers get the most value out of their operating assets.",
        "We provide complete rotating machinery train solutions, integrated electrical and controls equipment, digital solutions as well as a comprehensive range of services to support you over the entire lifecycle. We are a partner for your energy transition journey offering a variety of strategies and solutions to reach net zero goals, including integration of energy storage solutions, the production and transportation of hydrogen, and the integration of CO2 capture and compression technologies.  ",
