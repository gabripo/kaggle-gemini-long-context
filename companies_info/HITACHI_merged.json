            "Power transformers are the most important components of electrical energy supply networks. Although these components have high reliability, failures can occur due to external factors such as short circuits in the grid. Failures can also occur due to the aging effects of the active part, especially the insulation system, or the aging of important accessories such as bushings or on-load tap changers. In case of failure, the first action is to identify the type of failure. The aim is to localize the failure and its root cause.​\r\n​\r\nRepairing a transformer instead of replacing it can substantially reduce investment costs and provide a faster turnaround than buying a new transformer. Furthermore, to maximize the asset's technical life, a refurbishment or overhaul can be an intermediate action when no failure has occurred, and the aging of the active part has reached a stage where the continued reliability of the transformer is unacceptable.​",

Offering the full functionality and reliability of previous Switchsync products, it additionally includes Ethernet interfaces, which support modern communication protocols, and enhanced functionality and flexibility towards the user.",
            "Switchsync PWC600 is designed for single-pole operated circuit breakers, controlling each pole to close and/or open at the optimal point on the wave for the switched load, the circuit breaker, and power quality. It features unprecedented flexibility for switching various loads with diverse configurations, comprehensive monitoring functionality to track circuit breaker behavior, and handling multiple loads connected to the same breaker. For power transformers, PWC600 can estimate the residual fluxes in the core to minimize energization transients under all switching scenarios. For transmission lines, PWC600 can detect secondary arcs and predict the non-periodic gap voltage across the circuit breaker after a protection trip, to minimize switching overvoltages and prevent missing current zeros during auto-reclosing. It compensates for variations in environmental factors and drifts in circuit breaker properties. An intuitive configuration tool and local and web-based user interfaces facilitate easy access to the relevant functions. The product offers waveforms and operations recording facility with time & date stamping to assist in interpreting the controlled switching performance.",

The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core.

At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way.",

            "In a fast-changing environment, asset managers need to keep up with past challenges to produce, transmit, distribute, and deliver electrical power in a reliable way. Aging assets, rising energy demand, and the need to deliver without unplanned outages are some of the challenges utilities and industries are facing today around the world.",
            "Fixing these challenges means that new solutions are needed to maintain the installed base of assets as well as when refurbishing, repairing, or upgrading legacy transformers. Since the late 90s, Hitachi Energy has offered a modular three-step approach to a Condition-Based Maintenance or Reliability Centered Maintenance program:\n",
            "Step 1. Fleet screening survey: A quick scan of a large population (20 to 200 units) collects easily accessible data, such as unit nameplate data, oil and dissolved-gas-in-oil data, load profile, history of the unit, and sister units.\n",
            "Step 2. Condition assessment: At this stage, transformer design experts focus on a smaller number of units (10 to 20) identified in step 1. They use modern design rules and tools to evaluate the original design. Advanced diagnostic tests are performed to assess each of the principal properties of the transformer in a structured way. This assessment leads to an estimate of each transformer`s risk of failure and defines action plans to improve the reliability of each unit.",
            "Step 3. Expertise: The number of units to be further analyzed is typically limited to two or three out of a population of 100 units. This third module of the assessment process provides accurate information with respect to overloading transformers, enhancing their performance (power or voltage increase), or extending their lifetime.",
            "Our service offerings assess the operational condition of transformers, provide recommendations to mitigate risks, and enhance the performance of aged equipment to meet possible new requirements. It also provides state-of-the-art information on online monitoring solutions, maintenance, and repair options to be used to ensure reliable operating conditions.",
            "It is three steps approach that can be applied to a single or fleet of transformers. The steps include fleet screening, design and condition assessment, and life assessment /profiling of the transformer fleet. The reports provide each transformer's condition and life assessment with recommendations for further action in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of failures.",

            "In general, digital technology will reduce testing in the future, as all systems will become supervised and will allow you to shift from fixed, time-based to condition- or risk-based maintenance schemes. Specifically testing the digital substation provides a safer testing behavior that reduces the effort for disconnection voltage and current circuits.",
            "The digital substation has different entry points, making it easy for you to get started with the application and amount of technology that best fit your organization’s current needs and level of maturity. For example, you can begin with monitoring or communications to test how it benefits you in the short term. Once you’ve undertaken this step, the next step could be to translate this learning to the network or enterprise level. In short, you do not necessarily have to begin with an entire digital substation and instead can start with a test concept. Hitachi Energy has a long history of successfully delivering digital substation projects, having worked on more than 50 digital substations, and we are perfectly positioned to guide you through the project based on your pace and specific organizational needs.",
            "Digital technology improves safety because there are fewer signal connections or inadvertently opened CT circuits that could harm personnel during commissioning and service activities. ",
            "Digital substations reduce your carbon footprint because they require less space for protection and control panels. Also, functions that were previously executed by physically separate equipment can be integrated into one device.\n\n",
            "Achieve higher productivity with new asset management systems that include monitoring and diagnostics data from substation equipment. This added insight substantially improves the efficiency of service activities. Monitoring and diagnostics are strategic features for utilities, further reducing outage time and increasing reliability.\n\n",
            "Take the lead in the digitalization of your grid, ensure longer lifecycle of your assets, and ensure a more secure communication environment with IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 Hitachi Energy certified products and tools.  Hitachi Energy’s SAM600 and PCM600 are designed and certified to comply to the latest IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 standard, enabling interoperability and reliable communication between digital assets even in complex systems.",
            "Since its publication in 2004, the global IEC 61850 standard has been accepted at a remarkably fast rate. Developed with the support of Hitachi Energy, it is the first truly global standard in the electric utility field.\n\r\nThe evolution hasn't stopped there. Since the advent of the IEC 61850 edition 2 in 2011, which takes the standard outside of the substation, Hitachi Energy invested tremendous efforts in implementing this standard in our systems, tools, and products. We believe IEC 61850 is the basis for a successful and modern digital grid.",
            "The defining feature of a digital substation is the implementation of a process bus. The introduction of IEC 61850 in 2005 was a key enabler for digitization and digitalization of power systems everywhere. The various technological advances spurred by IEC 61850 raised customer expectations about the quality and reliability of power supply. The IEC 61850 process bus enables the substitution of point-to-point copper connections between IEDs and other devices (e.g., instruments transformers, gas monitoring, etc.) with a safe and standardized optical communication bus. ",
            "Hitachi Energy has a longstanding experience in digital substations, placing it at the market forefront of this technology innovation, ensuring compliance with the highest standards in the industry.\n",
            "Retrofitting is a vital and natural next step to extend the service life of your substation, helping to lower capital expenditure and increase network reliability.",
            "Retrofit scenarios are pivotal for substations, as the lifecycle of secondary equipment is typically half that of primary devices.",
            "However, retrofit projects are, by their nature, more challenging than new projects. This is because of compatibility challenges between the old and new devices, which, in turn, could cause operational disruptions during commissioning.",
            "There are many directions you can take to install or upgrade a substation, depending on needs and budget. Therefore, it is important to choose a strategic partner who is an expert in the field to ensure the smooth installation and functioning of your new or retrofitted substations.",

            "The innovative EconiQ retrofill solution uses eco-efficient fluoronitrile based gas mixture to replace SF6 in installed gas-insulated lines. This can be done with minimum changes to existing equipment while ensuring performance of the equipment and significantly lowering environmental impact.\n",
            "In this process, SF6 from the installed gas-insulated lines is evacuated and filled into gas bottles for recycling or disposal and the GIL is then flushed to remove any humidity. The new eco-efficient gas mixture is then filled into the GIL and the switchgear is re-energized to connect back to the grid. The process is relatively quick and enables the reuse of passive gas components designed for SF6 to be converted into non-SF6 equipment, thereby improving their environmental and lifecycle performance.",

Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\r\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications:",

            "Through continuous investments in Research & Development, Hitachi Energy became the inventor of the paperless, Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) bushing technology. In our flagship RIS line EasyDry®, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.\n",
            "Hitachi Energy’s paperless RIS bushings are made of a synthetic non-woven material that is wound around a conductor with aluminum foil inserts for electrical stress control. The core is afterward vacuum-impregnated with epoxy resin and cured, giving a partial discharge-free dry bushing.",
            "This paperless bushing technology has an advanced insulation performance due to its non-hygroscopic insulation that is not sensitive to moisture ingress and absorption. In addition, RIS bushings will have a superior effect on the power factor (dielectric losses), and the intrinsic aging behavior leading to an extended product lifetime.",

            "Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings.",

            "Safety and reliability are essential to the operation of power transformers. For the past 60 years, oil-filled, paper-insulated condenser bushings have been applied to power transformers. While they have faithfully served their purpose, ensuring these bushings' safe and reliable operation can be time-consuming and costly. Typical concerns voiced by users include damage or outage due to vandalism or attack, porcelain shards damaging equipment or injuring people, catastrophic fire, oil leaks, and flashover due to contamination.​",
            "The ANSI/IEEE market solution is the O Plus Dry™ bushing. Hitachi Energy's O Plus Dry bushing meets or exceeds IEEE standards. It uses no paper and no porcelain and contains no oil. It is less fragile than porcelain bushings and lighter in weight. It uses HTV silicone rubber weather sheds, which are hydrophobic and self-cleaning even in highly polluted environments.​\r\n ",

Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards.",

            "With EconiQ™ Implementation services, Hitachi Energy has created a tailored program that helps our customers analyze the environmental impact of power grid maintenance and project activities, defining concrete actions to reduce it, and compensate for the remaining emissions.\n\n The activities we execute during our power systems lifecycle are essential to secure their reliability. Working together with our customers to better understand the environmental impact of these activities is a key pillar of our offering. \n While life cycle assessments (LCAs) introduce a product-oriented vision of the environmental impact that normally leaves the impact of maintenance activities and projects out of scope. They are far from negligible for our customers’ overall environmental footprint. Every small contribution matters. \n",
            "Our EconiQ™ Implementation services provide a detailed mapping of all your service and project activities’ CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing your awareness and optimizing execution to reduce or even avoid your impact, as well as compensating the remaining footprint.",

This report will identify the emission hotspots of your services activities.\n\nDefine data-driven greener strategies\nHaving access to this data and the possibility of comparing various scenarios will allow you to define more efficient, data-driven strategies for carbon footprint improvement.",

In this context, our EconiQ™ product portfolio offers you more environmentally friendly assets (SF6-free high-voltage products, transformers with less pollutant oils, etc.). Avoiding a 100g SF6-leakage is equivalent to eliminating 2 tCO2 equivalent emissions.",
            "Preventing unnecessary activities\nPreventing unnecessary activities is one of the pillars of an efficient and sustainable maintenance strategy. After carefully considering whether a maintenance activity of a particular asset is even necessary, the next step is to think about how you can reduce the frequency of that task or if you can perform it more efficiently. This will lead to cutting the environmental impact of existing and future maintenance activities. For example, our analysis show that eliminating a small avoidable maintenance activity can result in approximately 0.5 – 1 tCO2 equivalent emission reduction.",
            "Execute with a smaller footprint\nBuilding on our domain expertise in the field and our large installed base, together we will evaluate the alternatives to execute site activities tasks more efficiently. To do so, we will examine using smart shipping strategies, finding alternatives to on-site interventions, and using digital technologies as much as possible to optimize maintenance strategies. Our analysis show that for short maintenance activities, traveling is sometimes the major contributor to the carbon footprint. Every time we avoid a flight from America to Europe using augmented reality support, we are saving more than 0.5 tCO2 equivalent emissions.",

Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\r\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications:",

            "Series Compensation with Thyristor Control (TCSC) enables rapid dynamic modulation of the inserted reactance. At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way.",
            "The TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.\n",

            "Distribution transformers enable safe voltage levels for power consumption. But they are often located in densely populated areas or close to sensitive ecosystems. Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards.",
            "Apart from being oil-free, all components of dry-type transformers are in solid form; they do not have flash points or require bushings. Thus, major causes of fire and oil spillage are eliminated. The majority of insulating components used dry-type transformers can also be easily recycled. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for dry-type transformers is much lower due to the lower cost of installation and the need for a fire suppression system.\n",
            "Hitachi Energy has been leading the development, manufacturing, and supply of dry-type transformers for more than 40 years - with path-leading technological innovation. Hitachi Energy offers a full range of dry-type transformers with primary voltages through 72.5 kV built according to all major standards, including IEC and ANSI. \n",
            "With recent technological advances, Hitachi Energy has successfully designed and installed a dry-type transformer that can withstand 100 kV / 550kV Basic Impulse Level (BIL). Thus paving the way for using this sustainable and environment-friendly transformer technology at even sub-transmission level.\n",
            "These transformers meet strict parameters with respect to electrical system demands and functioning in areas with extreme climatic conditions. Hitachi Energy's dry and cast transformers are virtually maintenance-free and are manufactured in accordance with industry and international standards, including ISO 9001.",
