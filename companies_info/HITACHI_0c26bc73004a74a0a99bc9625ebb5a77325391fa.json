        "When protecting power transformers, it can be challenging to maintain security during current transformer (CT) saturation for external faults while detecting low-magnitude internal faults.  ",
        "It’s often difficult to find a one-size-fits-all solution. Most transformer operations rely on modular, scalable, reliable, and sustainable transformer protection schemes. Hitachi Energy is your partner in providing reliable, cutting-edge, and flexible transformer protection solutions. ",
        "Hitachi Energy intelligent electronic devices (IED) offer fast and selective protection, monitoring, and control for all types of transformers, including step-up, two-winding, and three-winding transformers, as well as special transformers and reactors used in the transmission, distribution, and rail markets. \n",
        "Our transformer protection is built on IEC 61850 and showcases Hitachi Energy's leading-edge technology and application experience. \n",
