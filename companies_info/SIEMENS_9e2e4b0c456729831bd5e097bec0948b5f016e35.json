        "The SGT-A35 offers top reliability and availability for power generation and mechanical drive applications in the oil and gas industry. With a solid reputation in onshore and offshore service, this gas turbine has accumulated over 46 million hours in operation. It is the latest evolution in a technology portfolio refined over 40 years, utilizing proven components from industrial, marine, and aerospace service. The SGT-A35 provides class-leading power density in a compact, lightweight, and easily maintainable package designed specifically for oil and gas applications. ",
        "Class-leading flexibilty for the challenges of tomorrow",
        "The SGT-A35 portfolio includes 2 variants of gas generators and 3 variants of free power turbines, allowing multiple combinations with power output ranging between 32 and 38 MW in mechanical drive, and different drive-shaft speed. Each variant is available with or without Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion and can be configured for electrical generation or mechanical drive, onshore or offshore. Such a diverse portfolio ensures that the gas turbine can be ideally matched to your requirements of each application.",
        "The SGT-A35 has earned the trust of operators in a large spectrum of applications, in the power industry as well as in oil and gas. The SGT-A35 legacy spans over 40 years of continuous improvement through the incremental injection of aero engine technology. Over 850 SGT-A35 units have been sold to date, accumulating a service experience of over 46 million operating hours. The SGT-A35 is regarded as a class leader for reliability.",
        "All variants of the SGT-A35 can be restarted at any time following a shutdown from any condition, without any delay due to \"hot lockout\" conditions. Unlike some of its competitors, the SGT-A35 can achieve this reliably by inherent design. Thanks to its agile twin-spool architecture, the SGT-A35 provides the most robust solution to restoring power quickly when its availability is most critical.",
        "The SGT-A35 is the latest evolution in the portfolio, introducing a synchronous speed variant to the existing highspeed power turbine coupled to the prove gas generator to allow direct drive or geared drive of an electrical generator.",
        "The SGT-A35 can also be utilized in mechanical drive applications, making it one of the most flexible gas turbines in its range. Its performance is optimized for hot climates, delivering significantly more power at 30 °C than its predecessors.",
        "The SGT-A35 brings to oil and gas operators the trusted technologies acquired by Siemens Energy aeroderivative gas turbine portfolio. The reliable SGT-A35 gas turbines, with over 800 units supporting oil and gas operations worldwide, are now packaged with the oil and gas expertise of Siemens Energy, which has supplied over 1,000 units to the oil and gas industry over the years. The SGT-A35 package leverages the best designs and know-how of two trusted names in the oil and gas industry to produce superior customer value.",
        "A decades-old offshore gas turbine can be retrofitted to run on methanol, cutting emissions by 80%.",
        "The SGT-A35 uses an aeroderivative, 2-spool gas generator aerodynamically coupled to a free power turbine. Two variants of gas generators and two variants of power turbines are available to perfectly match your requirements in each application. The 2-spool architecture allows maximum operational flexibility, resulting in a gas turbine with high tolerance to transient excursions and challenging mission cycles, fast starting and with no \"hot lockouts\". All variants can operate on gaseous and liquid fuel, and can be configured with an optional Dry Low Emission (DLE) combustor.",
        "The SGT-A35 is the result of over 40 years of technological innovation. Utilizing aero engine technology with millions of operating hours accumulated in flight, the SGT-A35 has built a vast experience base of their own with over 46 million hours operating in power generation and mechanical drive service, onshore and offshore and in the most challenging environments.",
        "SGT-A35 gas turbines are already well proven in offshore applications, with over 15 million operating hours accumulated in fixed and floating offshore installations.",
        "Fit-for-purpose packaging features, and configurable options have been demonstrated across various oil and gas applications. Choices in mechanical systems, instrumentation, electrical devices, and materials cater to a range of international and API standards, environmental conditions, facility cooling schemes, and availability requirements.",
        "The SGT-A35 gas turbine is integrated into a compact package, proven in offshore oil and gas applications, offering a minimal footprint and the highest power density in its class. This maximizes production, reduces topside weight, lowers upfront capital investment, and increases long-term value creation. The design is reliable and compliant with the requirements of offshore oil and gas applications, including FPSO vessels.",
        "Our comprehensive portfolio of services provides low life cycle cost and optimum performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle: Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul service, field service, spare parts, service exchange, remote diagnostic service, and modernization and upgrades. Whether for scheduled service or short-term support, our specialists are there for you, on-site all over the world. Maintenance of the SGT-A35 engine can be accomplished quickly and easily due to the aero engine design.",
        "We can offer a truly global service presence. This includes an integrated offering of repair, service and maintenance, 24/7 remote monitoring and diagnostics, and customer technical training solutions to ensure high availability and optimum performance of equipment throughout the engine's lifecycle.",
        "Over its 40-year legacy, the SGT-A35 has been continuously improved for ease of maintenance, to maximize availability and reduce OPEX. The lightweight aeroderivative gas generator can be safely exchanged on-site within 24 hours, reducing maintenance downtime and cost.",
        "The SGT-A35 is a dual-fuel gas turbine capable of automatic changeover between gaseous and liquid fuels. It has been tested with a broad variety of gaseous and liquid fuels, including high proportions of inert gases found in deep sea offshore applications. The engine can burn up to 100% hydrogen with WLE burners and up to 15% hydrogen with DLE burners. A Dry Low Emission (DLE) option is available for all SGT-A35 variants.",
