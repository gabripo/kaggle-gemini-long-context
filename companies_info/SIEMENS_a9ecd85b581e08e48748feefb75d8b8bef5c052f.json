        "The world is hungry for energy, and climate change calls for lower emissions. Industries and power generation companies take on both challenges while running their daily operations.",
        "These are demanding times. The companies need efficient, reliable decarbonization technologies to succeed, plus innovative, individual solutions that adapt to their decarbonization strategies.",
        "We adapt to new realities and seize emerging opportunities. But decarbonization takes time. It’s not an overnight shift. We are pragmatic and thorough. Our approach is holistic and step by step.  ",
        "We improve the efficiency of existing energy assets. We upgrade and modernize wherever possible. The transition away from conventional fuels comes next. We move from coal to gas and then to hybrid systems and cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen.",
        "This is how Siemens Energy leads the way to a deeply decarbonized world. This is how we support governments, utilities, and industry to a transformed system of energy. ",
        "Click the animation below, and we'll take you on our energy transition journey. You will see how zero CO2 emissions can become reality.",
        "Siemens Energy will shape the future of energy systems. We want to be climate neutral. And we want to gradually decarbonize our portfolio.",
        "We already support our customers on their path towards decarbonization. Efficient, reliable technologies, and service solutions that reduce emissions and costs: Siemens Energy is here to transform the world of energy.",
        "Let’s get to work and make real what matters. Let’s energize society with our unique portfolio. Fuel-flexible and hydrogen-ready gas turbines. Combined cycle plants. Hybrid power and energy storage. Power-to-x and sector coupling. We have what it takes to decarbonize society. ",
        "ELEC lives in a light bulb. Energy is his life. So, he is quite curious about the energy transition and all that has to do with it. You are curious as well? Then our video series is just right for you. ",
        "Learn how synchronous condensers help to stabilize the grid …",
        "Travel into the future to learn why sector coupling is key for a decarbonized world.",
        "Find out which steps are necessary to reduce carbon emissions.",
