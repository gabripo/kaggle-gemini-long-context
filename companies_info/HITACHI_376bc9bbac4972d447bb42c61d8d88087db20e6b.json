        "Hitachi Energy's large-medium liquid-filled distribution transformers are used to receive energy from higher voltage levels and to transform and distribute this energy to lower voltage substations or directly to large industrial consumers.",
        "Distribution transformers in this range are three-phase and can be manufactured with an off-circuit tap changer or on-load tap-changer. Transformers provided with an on-load tap changer usually have a separate tap winding.",
        "The core is constructed of grain-oriented steel laminations. The windings are made of either copper or aluminum conductors and wound in a foil or multi-layer configuration. The tank construction can be a corrugated fin wall type or a rigid construction type with radiators typically used for larger transformers. Fans can also be mounted on the radiators to provide additional cooling capacity.",
