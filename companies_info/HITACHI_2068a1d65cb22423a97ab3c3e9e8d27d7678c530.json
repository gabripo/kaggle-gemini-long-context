        "There comes a time when all equipment reaches the end of its operational life. If you need to decommission and replace assets, Hitachi Energy provides consulting, project management, and onsite personnel to help you. We also offer obsolescence planning and recycling services.",
        "Retiring assets isn’t something you do every day, so it’s smart to get advice and assistance from experts like the Hitachi Energy Grid Automation team. We can help you cover all the steps of decommissioning equipment.",
        "Assessment and planning\nWe’ll start with a thorough assessment of your existing equipment to see if retrofits and upgrades could work instead of asset replacement. If a replacement is the best solution, we’ll develop a decommissioning plan that covers environmental concerns, safety precautions, and any regulatory requirements that may exist.",
        "Preparation\nIf permits are required, the Hitachi Energy team can help you obtain them. We’ll also map out safety protocols and ensure all your staff members who are slated to participate in the decommissioning are properly trained. If isolation and de-energization are needed, we’ll plan for that as well.",
        "Responsible removal and disposal\nOur team will follow proper dismantling procedures, aiming to minimize any possible environmental impacts and ensure worker safety. We’re experts at recycling and responsible disposal.",
        "Installation of new equipment\nUsing industry best practices, we’ll install and commission your new equipment. We’ll also test the assets to ensure that they’re performing correctly and safely. If issues or deficiencies exist, we’ll make adjustments and repairs.",
        "Handover and training for your staff\nIf you entrust your asset decommissioning and replacement to Hitachi Energy, know that we’re committed to making sure your team can manage the new equipment. We’ll train your workers to get optimal performance from the devices, maintain the equipment, and troubleshoot basic issues.",
        "We support you in assessing the life cycle status of your assets thanks to our extensive expertise and knowledge of substation automation products.",
