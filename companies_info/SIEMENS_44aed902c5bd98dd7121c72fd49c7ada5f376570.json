        "Control Solution for Microgrids and Hybrid Power Plants",
        "It is capable of managing a variety of different decentralized energy resources, automated, autonomously and in a coordinated way, ensuring reliable 24/7 operation. At the same time, it is flexible and scalable to support larger number of assets when needed.",
        "Microgrid with a Omnivise Hybrid Control solution",
        "Hybrid plants combine renewables with other solutions that eliminate their weak points. Omnivise Hybrid Control integrates the different technologies to make sure, that all components interact perfectly.",
        "Watch the video and learn more.",
        "In our webinar we talk about the automation requirements for such a hybrid energy system and present a live demo of our proven Omnivise T3000 control system.",
        "The Omnivise Hybrid Control solution consists of three main components:",
        "Manages all assets in real time.",
        "With integrated microgrid control functions, automated 24/7 operation is provided.",
        "Provides SCADA functions for monitoring and engineering of a microgrid, enabling the operator full overview and control.",
        "Calculates an optimal economic dispatch based on load and generation forecasts, as well as financial and technical parameters.",
        "The Microgrid Controller of the Omnivise Hybrid Control solution is based on the Siemens Energy standard plant control hardware Omnivise T3000. This ensures highest hardware standards in reliability, longevity and security. ",
        "Omnivise T3000 includes AS3000 Automation Server, and CS3000 Communication Server hardware modules.  It is designed for a wide range of applications and for rough environment conditions.  ",
        "Full redundancy and cyber security functions are provided on a hardware level.",
        "The innovative, flexible platform combines all automation and communication tasks. It provides real time capabilities as needed for demanding control and closed loop applications. Also, T3000 provides the runtime environment for demanding and complex optimization and programming tasks. An integrated dual redundancy link allows smaller footprinting and reduced wiring. The integrated 3rd party connectivity enables an efficient control system design with a scalable setup for easy expansion. Additionally, online repair can be performed with only a temporary interruption of the redundancy. I/Os are connected via PROFINET and/or via PROFIBUS. ",
        "Omnivise T3000 provides flexible connectivity options, e.g.:",
        "Omnivise Hybrid Control SCADA running on the application server gives operators and engineers full control and transparency over the microgrid. The solution is preconfigured with standard microgrid dashboards showing all necessary information, with several levels of detail.",
        "Main functions:",
        "Dispatch Optimizer supports Customers to perform optimal in complex trading/ marketing processes",
        "Per definition and standards, microgrids are entities which manage their own decentralized power production and consumption and are capable of island operation mode.",
        "Depending on a business case, many microgrids, always run in on-grid mode. Managing a microgrid with multiple different decentralized resources requires a hybrid microgrid controller to provide automated and at the same time optimal operation for the customer.",
        "Omnivise Hybrid Control is the perfect solution for large and mid-size microgrids, e.g., for IPPs, islands, industries, data centers, mines.",
        "Integrating large amount of renewable resources (PV, wind) on islands and remote areas which rely on conventional diesel generation can reduce overall fuel and operational costs.",
        "This however requires integration of additional energy storage (batteries, H₂) in a microgrid to ensure the reliable and stable power supply.",
        "Renewable resources (PV, wind, green H₂) and batteries can be well integrated with existing and new combined cycle power plants in a microgrid to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the overall system efficiency.",
        "With increasing cost of electricity and at the same time demand, C&I customers can install own generation to reduce their energy bills, and at the same time be able to run their essential load in off-grid mode. With CHPs and CCPs thermal energy is extracted for industrial processes, heating/cooling or electricity recuperation. With integration of rooftop PV, CO₂ emissions are reduced.",
        "The Omnivise Hybrid Control solution has proven its performance in installations all around the globe. Don't hesitate to ask us about examples of projects that match your requirements.",
        "We appreciate your interest in our product. If you have questions or need more information, feel free to contact us!",
