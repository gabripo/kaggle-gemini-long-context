        "Substation transformers transfer the incoming high-voltage to the next lower voltage level. As an example, an incoming high-voltage of 400 kV would be transferred down to 220 kV.",
        "In general, substation transformers are equipped with on-load-tap-changers (OLTC). Incoming transmission lines are connected to the transformers through bushings and cables through cable boxes and cable sealing ends. These transformers are built in core form with auto-connected windings, ie common main winding and a separate low voltage winding.",
