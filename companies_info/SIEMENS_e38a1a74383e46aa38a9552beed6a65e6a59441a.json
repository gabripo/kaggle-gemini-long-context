        "The SGT6-5000F is able to burn a wide range of fuels including natural gas, LNG, syngas, ethane, propane, Arabian Super Light crude oil, distillate oil, condensate, Arabian Extra Light crude oil, biodiesel, alcohols, Jet-A oil, and kerosene.",
        "The engine offers dual fuel capability and tolerates fuels within a wide Wobbe range.  ",
        "The combustion system is able to handle different fuel compositions, e.g. contents of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) of up to 4,000 ppm, or hydrogen (H2) of up to 30 vol%. Its system can switch over quickly between fuel gas and fuel oil and vice versa.",
        "Our proven, low-risk design translates into longer service intervals and service life for your gas turbine. All rotating blades are replaceable without de-stacking or lifting the rotor.",
        "Extensive experience in commercial operation means that you can rely on proven and validated package and plant concepts that enable early power generation in simple cycle. Projects are implemented quickly, fast project execution due to modularized package and plant design and pre-engineered solutions.  ",
        "The SGT6-5000F features a 13-stage axial compressor with advanced 3D blade design. Three rows of variable guide vanes enable improved part load efficiency and transient operation. The rotor design of the 260 MW version is based on a single tie rod with Hirth serrations for reliable torque transmission. ",
        "Variable inlet guide vanes plus three stages of fast-acting variable guide vanes improve the part load efficiency of the 260 MW engine.",
        "The 4-stage turbine uses proven, conventional materials to maximize maintenance intervals and availability.",
        "The gas turbine package for the SGT6-5000F consists of the core turbine, the generator and auxiliary systems. We offer you a standardized basic design with options ideally geared to your specific requirements and market enrvironment. This approach ensures that your operating costs are as low as possible while at the same time providing maximum flexibility for your individual requirements.",
        "Designed for short installation times, all package piping is prefabricated to minimize pipe cleaning and welding on site.  Package footprint:",
        "The packages include the gas turbine, generator, air intake system, exhaust gas system, auxiliary systems, power control center, instrumentation and control, and electrical systems.",
        "SGT6-5000F-based combined cycle plants have the capability for fast start-up. With these plants, you can achieve combined cycle base load within 5 min for hot start. High load gradients (40 MW/min) allow for fast load changes. With excellent peaking capability, and high part load efficiency complying with emission regulations down to lower part load, this is your profitable solution for competitive energy markets with fluctuating power demand.",
        "The SGT6-5000F multi-shaft combined cycle plants can be based on one (SCC6-5000F 1x1), two (SCC6-5000F 2x1) or more F-class gas turbines.",
        "With its high steam raising capability, the SGT6-5000F is excellently suited for cogeneration or CHP applications, e.g., for",
        "For combined cycle applications with CHP, you can use a condensing or backpressure steam turbine, with or without steam extraction.",
        "We offer Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul services, field service, spare parts, reconditioning of components and modernization upgrades. Whether scheduled service or short-term support, our specialists are there for you, on-site all over the world. Siemens is continuously improving the SGT6-5000F gas turbines, and upgraded parts are retrofittable into the existing fleet.",
        "Our design strives to achieve a long service life for your gas turbine while minimizing risk. Thanks to low firing temperatures we can use proven conventional turbine alloys to prolong service intervals and service life.",
