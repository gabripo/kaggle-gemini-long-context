        "Global challenges like urbanization, scarce resources, and climate change fuel demand for efficient, low-/net-zero power generation and renewable energy.  That’s why energy systems are already undergoing a rapid transformation – and adapting to the high shares of renewables that will be essential for future energy systems.",
        "We’re helping our customers to successfully meet their challenges – from industrial companies and power utilities to energy investors and governments. Whether we’re talking about conventional or renewable energy: We develop energy concepts to deepen the knowledge and understanding of the energy landscape of countries and regions. We also formulate country-specific energy implementation roadmaps to enable their ecological, economic, and social development. ",
        "Utilizing our advanced technology, solutions, services, and capabilities, we strive to set new benchmarks for decarbonization and the evolution of the energy system.",
        "Karim Amin",
        " Member of the Executive Board & Executive Vice President Gas Services, Siemens Energy ",
        "The energy industry is experiencing numerous opportunities driven by factors such as the move towards decarbonized energy systems, on-site power generation, and cutting-edge digital service solutions.",
        "occur step by step: We improve the efficiency of existing assets. The transition away from conventional fuels comes next – from coal to gas and then to hybrid systems and cleaner fuels. Learn how we’re pushing the boundaries of both conventional and renewable energy to meet the demand for sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy. ",
        "is becoming more and more important in the new energy era. Do you want to integrate renewables? Bring reliable and affordable electricity to remote areas? Or achieve decarbonization goals using local energy generation and storage?  Explore how on-site power generation secures your power supply for the future.",
        "are critical for maximizing the lifecycle value of power and heat generation assets. Our services and digital service solutions help you extend the lifespan of your assets. Discover what Siemens Energy services can do for you – and how to implement competitive and innovative methods to reduce downtime and increase output.",
        "There is an increasing need, and potential, for hydrogen to decarbonize power generation. In this comprehensive whitepaper, learn about how Siemens Energy is approaching this unprecedented opportunity, readying gas turbines for the energy transition. ",
