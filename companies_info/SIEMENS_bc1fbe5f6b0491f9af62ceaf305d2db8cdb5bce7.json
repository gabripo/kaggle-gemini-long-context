        "We offer an extensive portfolio of high-voltage station arresters in several versions for every conceivable application and even specific demands. Our surge arresters protect devices in equipment for applications up to 1,200 kV.",
        "Main features:",
        "Siemens Energy 3EL silicone rubber surge arresters with cage design provide outstanding protection against overvoltages in networks up to 800 kV.",
        "Siemens Energy 3 EL cage design surge arresters are ideally suited for the reliable protection of:",
        "The cage, made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) rods, provides a rigid, reinforced structure ensuring high mechanical strength. The silicone rubber housing is directly molded onto the metal oxide varistors (MOVs) and the surrounding cage made of FRP rods. This creates a reliable seal that prevents moisture ingress and partial discharges.",
        "The MO resistors are not surrounded by a rigid mechanical coating, which is why no critical increases in pressure can occur in the surge arrester in the extremely rare event of an overload. The arc can escape directly through the soft silicone housing without damaging the mechanical structure. No internal parts are ejected in the process. The innovative Siemens Energy cage design is very secure.",
        "The silicone rubber is highly hydrophobic and UV-resistant. This keeps any conductive moisture from forming on the surface, and dirt deposits are rendered harmless as a result of the hydrophobic transfer. Silicone is highly fire-retardant and self-extinguishing in the event of fire. These properties ensure the reliable, maintenance-free operation of 3EL surge arresters. They are also lightweight, allowing for easy transport and a variety of installation options. 3EL surge arresters are suitable for use as station or line surge arresters.",
        "Siemens Energy 3EQ surge arresters with silicone housing and a composite hollow core design are ideally suited for the reliable protection of:",
        "The surge arrester with the composite hollow core design uses silicone and fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) as housing materials. The direct molding of the silicone onto the FRP hollow core ensures reliability, while an excellent special sealing of the flanges at both ends of the surge arrester effectively prevents partial discharges and moisture ingress. This guarantees decades of trouble-free operation.",
        "The combination of silicone rubber and the fiberglass-reinforced hollow core also allows for outstanding mechanical stability.",
        "The surge arrester with the composite hollow core design provides a very high degree of safety: In the event of an overload or the extremely rare case of an arrester short circuit, the arc escapes directly through directional pressure relief devices.",
        "The surge arrester can be oriented to minimize the risk of damage to facilities and injuries to people nearby. Internal parts are not ejected, and the housing does not break.",
        "3EQ surge arresters can be used as station or support insulators. They are ideally suited for areas with the heaviest seismic activity, extremely strong winds and in support functions.",
        "Siemens Energy 3EP porcelain surge arresters offer outstanding protection against overvoltages in networks of up to 800 kV.",
        "3EP porcelain surge arresters are ideally suited for the reliable protection of:",
        "The excellent sealing system prevents moisture ingress and partial discharges.",
        "In the extremely rare event of an overload, the arc can escape directly through the directional pressure relief devices. Strong, high-quality porcelain prevents the ejection of internal parts. The Siemens Energy porcelain design offers extremely safe overload performance.",
        "3EP porcelain surge arresters are ideal for areas with heavy seismic activity and extremely strong winds.",
