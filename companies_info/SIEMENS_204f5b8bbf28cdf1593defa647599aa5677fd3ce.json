        "Energy System Design (ESD) enables customized energy systems for economically viable steps towards decarbonization or new Power-to-X revenue streams. Together, we develop individual solutions to help you decarbonize and create new businesses. Our ESD approach looks at future revenue potentials, the site environment and balances your goals, e.g., decarbonization targets, with your specific economical and technical boundary conditions. We provide solutions that support you on the way to your sustainable energy system.",
        "Future revenue streams",
        "We help you identify potential future revenue streams in a volatile environment by analyzing various scenarios.",
        "Optimal asset configuration",
        "Determine the optimal asset combination and sizing within a wide possible solution space.  ",
        "Decarbonization path",
        "We help you create and implement a robust, step-by-step roadmap for technology selection. ",
        "For a comprehensive understanding of our approach to ESD, we invite you to read our detailed ESD white papers. These documents explore the advanced methodologies and technologies we use to create efficient, sustainable, and reliable energy systems.",
        "Evaluation of the decarbonization potential of existing industrial plants. Developing a solid decarbonization roadmap to make existing infrastructure future-ready.",
        "Brownfield Transformation of existing assets like fossil power plants considering local markets for electricity, district heating and process steam. Develop a decarbonization roadmap.",
        "Optimized technology selection and sizing of hydrogen and e-fuel synthesis plants powered by renewable energy. Our expertise is exemplified by projects like Haru Oni, which demonstrated the pracital application of Power-to-X technology. For further information, have a look into our Power-to-X white paper. ",
        "By integrating renewables, energy storage, and dispatchable generation, we create optimized hybrid energy systems that enhance reliability and efficiency. To learn more, explore our hybrid power solutions webpage and our detailed cost-optimized design of hybrid power plants white paper.",
        "Regardless of the project type e.g., industrial decarbonization, hydrogen and Power-to-X, hybrid power or power plant sites, our Energy System Design follows a very structured and consultative approach that is characterized by great collaboration between you and us:",
        "Understanding your vision of your future business",
        "Optimize your future energy system",
        "Pathway to your future energy system",
        "Modern energy systems can consist of a variety of building blocks that convert, store and transfer different energy-related commodities. The design of energy systems requires the selection of technologies and the definition of their rated power or capacity in a way that all existing loads can be covered. Simultaneously, the plant’s future dispatch needs to be considered, e.g., to account for volatile solar and wind power generation or fluctuating energy demands and commodity prices. Hence, a holistic planning and evaluation process of energy systems represent a challenging task in which we aim to support our customers with individual solutions that combine economic viability, sustainability, and security of supply.",
        "Due to the numerous degrees of freedom and boundary conditions, this planning process cannot be tackled with simple spreadsheet-based tools. Instead, mathematical optimization models are used in the scientific and industrial context to solve complex Energy System Design (ESD) problems. For this we make use of professional state-of-the-art ESD tools, mathematical solvers for linear and mixed-integer linear models, and methods for complexity reduction (e.g., time series aggregation and multi-stage solving methods).",
        "Power-to-X",
        "Green hydrogen, a CO₂-free energy carrier and key for Power-to-X solutions, offers opportunities for clean power and decarbonization.",
        "Green hydrogen production",
        "Discover more about our innovative green hydrogen production methods and how they can transform your energy landscape by visiting our green hydrogen production webpage. ",
        "CertaLink certification",
        "Certify your green products with CertaLink certification from Siemens Energy. Benefit from our expertise and support in green certification.",
