        "Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) is used to supervise, manage and analyze performance of all type of high-voltage switchgear in new installations as well as a retrofit solution in existing high-voltage assets. The system operates independently of existing control and protection devices and can be installed in new substations or retrofitted in existing installations. By continuously monitoring critical parameters, MSM provides the base layer for a predictive maintenance strategy for the installation.The system is compliant with IEC 61850 and DNP 3.0 and it is provided with a web interface where all monitored data are accessible.",
        "Applications\n",
        "Based on the monitoring application, MSM is offered in 2 versions with additional options:",
        "Why Hitachi Energy?\r\n  ",
        "SF6 moisture",
        "Highly stable SF6 and gas density sensors are used to continuously monitor the integrity of the gas compartments and identify gas losses at an early stage. Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\r\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications:",
        "MSM gas monitoring feature is compatible with EconiQTM portfolio and other gas mixtures.",
        "Non-invasive hall sensors and signals from auxiliary switches are used to monitor key parameters of the circuit breaker. Measured signals include phase current during operation, trip and close coil current, and motor current. Monitored parameters are categorized in mechanical performance, wear, as well as accessories. Measured curves are stored as comtrade files on the system, allowing further analysis. \n\r\nAll features of MSM-I are included in this application as well.\n\nBenefits of MSM-II for circuit-breaker applications:\n",
        "Humidity Monitoring",
        "High levels of humidity in SF6 impact its dielectric withstand (the condensation of water on the surface of insulators will lead to significant reduction of dielectric strength and flashover) and on the formation of corrosive and toxic decomposition products. It is important to control humidity during initial manufacture, assemble, commissioning and over the lifetime of the equipment.",
        "Continuous humidity monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II.",
        "Correct heater operation in drives, cubicles, etc. is crucial for reliable operation of circuit breakers.",
        "Monitoring of heaters is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II\n",
        "\r\nDisconnector and earthing switch monitoring\n",
        "Disconnector and earthing switches are critical live components of high-voltage switchgears. Disconnector monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II",
        "\r\nInternal arc localization\n",
        "Detect an internal fault arc and localize the gas compartment where it occurs is important since the event has a possible impact on gas dielectric withstand.",
        "MSM allows to reduce the effort to determine the fault location by gas pressure analysis, automatically identifying the gas compartment where an arc occurs. ",
        "Internal arc localization is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II.",
        "\r\nTravel curve monitoring with measured travel curve\n",
        "Mechanical performance of switchgear depends on the travel characteristic of the closing and open operations.",
        "MSM-II can simulate travel curve but if accurate travel curve measure is needed, the travel curve monitoring with measured travel curve option can be installed.",
