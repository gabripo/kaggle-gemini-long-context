        "The SGT-100 industrial gas turbine is a proven unit for all electrical power generation and mechanical drive applications.",
        "The compact arrangement, on-site or off-site maintainability, and inherent reliability make it an ideal gas turbine for the demanding oil and gas industry. The gas turbine has a rugged industrial design that enables high efficiency and excellent emissions performance on a wide range of gaseous and liquid fuels. ",
        "With the SGT-100 your plant will benefit from world-class availability in addition to maximum operational flexibility. The standard Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system can operate on both liquid and gaseous fuels with low levels of NOₓ and CO emissions. At the same time, it allows for full load acceptance and shedding with automatic fuel changeover – without affecting turbine operation.",
        "The SGT-100 has been used by the oil and gas industry since 1992. Many operating hours in both power generation and mechancial drive applications have provided oil and gas operators with the reliable operation expected in this demanding industry.",
        "The SGT-100 has units operating in a wide range of ambient conditions: from extreme cold to hot and humid through to hot and dusty. The SGT-100 package design offers several standard options to cater for these wide variations in ambient conditions.",
        "Our SGT-100 gas turbine is available with a Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system, a modern approach that avoids injected diluents and addresses the production of low  NOₓ with a proven design. You will benefit from extremely low NOₓ emission levels with both gas and liquid fuels, as this gas turbine offers dual-fuel capability.",
        "With its rugged industrial design and lightweight core engine, the SGT-100 is easy to maintain. You will benefit from minimal downtime and maximum availability thanks to long service intervals combined with rapid core engine exchange capability. An on-site maintenance option is available if you wish. Our industrial gas turbines are characterized by a long service life.",

        "Available in onshore and offshore configuration, e.g.,",
        "Available for various power generation needs:",
        "The mechanical drive package is very compact, providing a small footprint and a high power-to-weight ratio.",
        "The first stage rotor blades can be axially removed for quick and easy in-situ changeout, maximizing availability.",
        "Combustion pressure casings split for easy access to the combustion hardware",
        "In our download section, you can find brochures, technical papers, and more. Or you can contact us directly for specific inquiries.",
        "Technical papers",
        "More than 420 units have been sold with more than 25 million operating hours. The lead package has over 180,000 equivalent hours of operation.",
