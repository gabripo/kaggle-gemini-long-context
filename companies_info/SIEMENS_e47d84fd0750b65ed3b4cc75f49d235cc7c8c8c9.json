        "The SGT-600 combines robustness with an excellent maintenance program for high availability and low costs for operation. ",
        "With high reliability, excellent fuel flexibility, and third-generation DLE technology, the SGT-600 is a perfect choice for industrial power generation in combined heat and power (CHP), combined circle power plants (CCPP), onshore oil and gas power generation, and mechanical drives, offering efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",
        "The SGT-600 offers best-in-class fuel flexiblity that allows for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons: ",
        "The SGT-600 features a third-generation dual-fuel Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system:",
        "The SGT-600 features a reliable, robust and easily maintainable design for maximized uptime.",
        "Thanks to a long lifetime with maximized uptime, low life cycle cost and easy servicability, the SGT-600 offers you a high lifetime profitability. The robust industrial design offers a low degradation over time.",
        "The SGT-600 offers you best-in-class availability thanks to a robust and reliable design. The compact twin-shaft engine is easy to maintain and allows for flexible opeation.",
        "Using the same design for power generation and mechanical drive increases the operational experience.",
        "Thanks to the compact architecture, the SGT-600 package offers you a small footprint. The package has a modular and flexible design and features single-lift capability. The driver for both power generation and mechanical drive package is the same. ",
        "A gas turbine package includes: Gas turbine, enclosure, base frame, air intake, exhaust, lubricating systems, starter system, vibration monitoring system, firefighting system, package ventilation system, instrumentation, gas detection, fuel systems, gearbox (if needed).",
        "The SGT-600’s ability to handle sudden load changes and its high exhaust temperature make it ideal for simple cycle, combined cycle, cogeneration, and other heating applications.",
        "The SGT-600 mechanical drive packages offer long lifecycles and can withstand extreme climates ranging from desert heat to arctic cold, oil platforms, and harsh industrial environments.",
        "For combined cycle and cogeneration (combined heat and power – CHP), we offer a broad range of power plant configurations and scopes based on the SGT-600 gas turbine. For combined cycle, 1x1 or 2x1 configurations are part of the standardized portfolio.",
        "Good combined cycle performance: In a 2x1 combined cycle configuration, the power output is 74.2 MW(e) at a net plant efficiency of 51.6%.",
        "Our comprehensive portfolio of services provides low life cycle cost and optimum performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle: Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul service, field service, spare parts, service exchange, remote diagnostic service, and modernization and upgrades.",
        "With only 14 scheduled maintenance days over a 17-year service cycle, the SGT-600 provides highest operational availability.  ",
        "Whether scheduled service or short-term support, our specialists are there for you, on-site or off-site all over the world. Our 24-hour global help desk ensures you peace of mind.",
        "The SGT-600 offers best-in-class fuel flexibility that allows for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons: ",
        "Features:",
        "The SGT-600 requires low gas supply pressure at site: 24.5 bar(a) / 355.5 psi(a).",
        "The combustor and burner design give world-class emission performance over a wide load range and are capable of ≤ 9 ppmvd NOₓ emission levels. Low emission levels are also received on liquid fuel without need of water injection.",
        "Emissions for 100 – 50% load, NOₓ at 15% O₂:",
        "Emissions for 100 – 50% load, CO at 15% O₂:",
        "(Emissions depend upon site conditions, required load range and other project-specific data.)",
        "Dimensions exclude inlet filter housing and exhaust stack. For power generation, the AC generator is included. For mechanical drive, the driven equipment is excluded.",
        "In our download section, you can find brochures, technical papers, and more. Or you can contact us directly for specific inquiries.",
        "Technical papers",
        "More than 350 units have been sold with over 12 million equivalent operating hours, and 185,000 equivalent operating hours for the fleet-leading gas turbine.",
