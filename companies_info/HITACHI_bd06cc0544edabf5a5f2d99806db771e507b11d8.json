        "We provide genuine, high-quality spare parts and consumables, be they loose parts, sub-assemblies, or complete finished products, for maintenance of an existing installation. Using the extensive Hitachi Energy network, we are able to reduce downtime and get production up as quickly as possible. Some parts can be purchased quickly “off-the-shelf” from the manufacturer. Other parts can take months to obtain.",
