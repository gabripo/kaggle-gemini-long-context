        "As a leading supplier of reciprocating compressors, our extensive Dresser-Rand portfolio of slow speed process reciprocating compressors and medium to high-speed separable units enable us to offer products for applications across both  process and decarbonization industries.",
        "Our reciprocating compressors are used in a wide range of applications, helping customers across the globe through their energy transition, increasing efficiency and lowering emissions step by step. Applications include:",
        "Our process reciprocating compressors are available with up to 10 crank throws, as single-throw or balanced-opposed configurations. We custom engineer every unit by designing each cylinder and valve, and select other components to meet your specific operating requirements. Our factory experts check all critical clearances and dimensions, and perform inspections and tests to prevent installation problems. The result is a reciprocating compressor that meets or exceeds client specifications, while delivering unmatched efficiency and reliability.",
        "With the most versatile compressor lineup on the market and a reputation for serving standard applications and the most demanding jobs (high pressure, CO₂, sour and acid gases, and floating applications), we cover virtually every application. This class of reciprocating compressors is designed to meet ISO 13631 with options to meet ISO 13707, or API 618 specifications. Our offering includes three different models with horsepower (HP) ranges up to 7,800 HP (5,816 kW), allowable rod loads up to 75,000 PSI (333kn), rated maximum speeds up to 1,500 RPM, and pressures up to 10,000 PSIG. Click on the model types below to learn more about our best in class.",
        "Valve performance and reliability is key to compressor performance. By paying careful attention to reliability in every aspect of the design, we’ve created a valve that can run more than 50 percent longer than other valves before needing service. We’ve proven it in thousands of hours of tests, many at high speeds and high temperatures, with a wide range of gases. Our engineers select the most appropriate valve based on their extensive experience as well as tools such as our Dynamic Valve Analysis (DVA) program.",
        "Most compressors produce more capacity than needed to allow for process control. The excess capacity is typically recycled to the inlet of the compressor to meet demand. The energy required to recycle the excess capacity is wasted.",
        "Variable capacity control systems give operators the ability to adjust compressor capacity to demand eliminating recycle. This reduces energy usage and operating costs.",
        "Variable capacity control devices are becoming more prevalent in the process market because of increased energy costs and the desire to save energy and related expenses whenever possible.",
        "We offer the state-of-the-art reciprocating compressor upgrades and modernizations to help improve the reliability and availability of your equipment.",
        "Enhancing the performance of your gas engine, regardless of its OEM, is not just a service, it's a commitment to excellence. With a focus on reliability, efficiency, turnkey solutions and responsiveness, we at Siemens Energy take pride in being your trusted partner throughout your engine's entire lifecycle.
