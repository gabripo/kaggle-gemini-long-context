        "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. ",
        "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.",
        "The only way to achieve Zero GWP and zero toxicity is by using clean air. Gas-insulated switchgear combine vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.",
        "Enabling higher voltage levels ​for wind turbines​. It is essential to live energy transition and increase resource efficiency. ​Wind power generation is making a major contribution for the  growing power demand and a new generation of wind power plants require innovative technologies. ​Our compact, environmentally friendly, high-voltage gas-insulated 8VM1 Blue GIS for on- & offshore installations up to 72.5 kV is an optimal contribution to enlarged wind turbine power and reduced cable losses.",
        "The 8VN1 Blue GIS maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2.",
        "Also in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV. ",
        "LPITs are innovative voltage and current transformers providing a safe, reliable and standardized solution for measurement and protection applications in GIS.",

        "The 8VM1 Blue GIS® is now certified to withstand real earthquake conditions. The qualification level was tested “high”, which ensures structural integrity and continuous functionality during highest loads.",
        "Resilience for high-voltage equipment: An 8VN1 Blue GIS typical bay for the 145 kV level successfully passed seismic qualification shake-table tests in line with IEEE 693 high level specifications. Neither the specimen nor the support structure sustained any structural damage or suffered from impaired functionality as a result of the tests.",
        "Cerius is the first utility in Denmark to order a Clean Air insulated switchgear with vacuum switching technology.",
        "Netze BW, Burladingen, Germany",
        "Siemens Energy has delivered more than 4000 units of sustainable transformers and gasinsulated switchgear for the installation in the nacelles and towers of offshore wind parks. This is an important contribution to the expansion of renewable energy sources, which is in line with the outcome of the latest world energy forum report. Besides, it supports the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. ",
        "Siemens Energy has been awarded the contract to deliver ten bays of Blue gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) to Fingrid, Finland’s transmission system operator. It will be the first GIS in Finland that replaces F-gases with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with zero potential for global warming. This will be the most significant Blue installation to date.",
