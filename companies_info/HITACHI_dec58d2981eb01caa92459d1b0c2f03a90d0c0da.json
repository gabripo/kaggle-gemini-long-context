        "Hitachi Energy offers both high-voltage and low-voltage bushings designed for use in pad or surface-mounted transformers. The bushings insulate the current-carrying conductor from the tank, allowing for the airside conductor and transformer lead termination. Both the high and low-voltage bushings conform to ANSI/IEEE standards.",
        "One-inch and five-eighth-inch low-voltage bushings are molded from a glass-reinforced, high-temperature nylon resin. The inch-and-a-quarter low-voltage bushing is molded from a polyester resin. All of the low-voltage bushings provide a spade terminal for internal connection and a threaded stud for external connection.\r\n ",
