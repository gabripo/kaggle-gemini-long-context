        "Distribution and small power transformers ranging from 315 kVA to 5 MVA are readily distributed across the distribution networks, forming an integral part of the overall distribution network. Upon receipt of the transformer in the factory for repair, visual and electrical control will be performed.",
        "Based on the scope of work and repairs generally, the repair time for the distribution is short, and in some cases, it could be between 3-5 weeks. ",
        "In some cases, it may require replacing items that are not normally stock items. In those cases, the lead times are adjusted after reviewing with the customer.",
        "Depending on the size and the inspection, intervention of active parts, including the repair of minor insulation damage, can be performed. ",
        "Service on accessible parts such as the tap changer, bushings, oil handling, drying the active part, and necessary tests are performed before returning the unit back to the customer.",
