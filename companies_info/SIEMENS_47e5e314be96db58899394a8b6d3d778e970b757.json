        "Our Energy Transition journey will take us towards a more sustainable future with new and emerging energy solutions, such as floating offshore wind, tidal power and offshore carbon capture and storage along with the electrification of existing oil and gas assets. Our established market leading wet mate connectors, subsea sensors and systems are perfectly positioned and ready to support the energy transition and achievement of the global net zero targets.",
        "As offshore wind farms move further offshore, knowledge, experience and technology from established offshore industries such as Oil and Gas are vital for the industry to reach its full potential.  Our HV and optical wet mate connectors, subsea hubs and subsea power grid are vital components to help drive down the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).",
        "Tidal Energy has an important part to play in the Energy Transition, however, it is vital the industry reduces costs.  By using established methods of offshore installation and intervention to maintain subsea turbines, the cost can be heavily reduced.  Our wet mate connector and subsea power grid technology can support the much needed reduction in cost.",
        "As we move closer towards global net zero target dates, it is vital that we not only focus on green energy generation but also on reducing the effects of existing power generation and manufacturing. The energy industry is taking on this challenge and storing vast amounts of C02 in the seabed.  Our existing wet mate connector and subsea pressure and temperature sensors are perfectly positioned to support this fast growing industry.",
        "With traditional industries such as Oil and Gas needing to evolve and become part of the energy transition, it is vital that new technologies and greener power generation are explored, especially when we look to decarbonize existing assets.  Subsea technology can support this while keeping disruptions to production and expensive modifications to a minimum.",
