        "Hitachi Energy instrument transformers are designed to transform high current and high voltage levels down to low current and low voltage outputs in a known and accurate proportion specified by the end user. An instrument transformer must be capable of withstanding very high stresses in all climatic conditions. Hitachi Energy designs and manufactures products for a service life of at least 30 years. Actually, most last even longer.",
        "The JV is expected to expand Hitachi Energy’s gas-insulated instrument transformers portfolio and accelerate new technology development in eco-efficient innovation\n",
        "To protect the electrical network and help prevent power outages, the contract also includes the supply of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), air-insulated switchgear (AIS) equipment such as circuit breakers, instrument transformers and hybrid modules.\n",
        "Innovative micro substations bring power to rural areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n",
        "Hitachi Energy’s high-voltage technologies will secure reliable power supply to four datacenters\n",
        "Current Transformers, Inductive Voltage Transformers, Capacitive Voltage Transformers, Combined Current/Voltage Transformers and Station Service Voltage Transformers are designed to transform high current and high voltage levels down to low current and low voltage outputs in a known and accurate proportion specified by the product nameplate ratios. All units are tailored for specific applications, either to operate accurately at steady state conditions or to maintain reasonable accuracy reading up to extreme fault level conditions. ",
        "These products consist of high dielectric strength oil-filled designs using paper and foil shields impregnated with refined dehydrated and degassed transformer oil, or stress-controlled, shield-graded SF6 gas-insulated designs. This ensures conservative reliable performance for decades of service in demanding global outdoor environments.",
        "Hitachi Energy is an innovator in instrument transformer technology and has the most comprehensive product line in the market. Access to the latest technology, global sourcing and up-to-date processes ensures long life and meets the most stringent needs defined by the industry. Some of the important benefits offered by Hitachi Energy supply are:\r\n ",
