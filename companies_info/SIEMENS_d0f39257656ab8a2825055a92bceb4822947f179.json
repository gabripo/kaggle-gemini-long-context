        "Thermal mechanical long-term storage is an innovative energy storage technology that utilizes thermodynamics to store electrical energy as thermal energy for extended periods. ",
        "Siemens Energy Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is a comprehensive, proven, grid-scale energy storage solution. We support projects from conceptual design through commercial operation and beyond. Our CAES solution includes all the associated above ground systems, plant engineering, procurement, construction, installation, start-up services and long term service support.",
        "As renewable power generation from wind and solar grows in its contribution to the world’s energy mix, utilities will need to balance the generation variability of these sustainable resources with demandfluctuations. Power-generation operators can use compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology for a reliable, cost-effective, and long-duration energy storage solution at grid scale. ",
        "Siemens Energy CAES improves utilization of renewable energy resources by absorbing GW-hours of energy that would otherwise be curtailed and provides grid balancing and reserve services with lower fuel usage and carbon footprint than other controllable resources. ",
        "Diabatic storage units dissipate part of the compression heat into the atmosphere with intercoolers. The air must be reheated to be returned to the CAES cycle. Energy and ancillary services with low fuel consumption provide best efficiency.",
        "The adiabetic CAES cycle stores energy in form of pressure in a cavern, while compression heat is stored in a thermal storage. For re-electrification both forms of energy are being utilized. No additional fuel is needed to heat up the released air. ",
        "Flexible and efficient power generation with 90 percent turndown of rated output\n\n",
        "Flexible and efficient load absorption with 30 percent turndown of rated output\n\n",
        "The compressor portfolio of Siemens offers efficiency and reliability on a long-term basis. It's made to meet customers’ needs in any industry.",
        "As a market leader for industrial steam turbines, we offer a comprehensive range of reliable and versatile steam turbines for the power output range from 2 to 250 MW. Our industrial steam turbines are designed for easy constructability, fast start-up and economical operation.",
        "Reliable generators from 0.3 up to 2,235 MVA - the perfect solution wherever power has to be generated quickly, reliably and efficiently",
        "Responds quickly - Designed to be started and brought to full load in less than 10 minutes, eliminating the need for intermediate-load plants and providing a cost-effective way to meet spinning reserve requirements. \n",

        "Full compression can be available in less than five minutes to quickly absorb load rather than reducing your base load generation.\n",
        "Full compression can be available in less than five minutes to quickly absorb load rather than reducing your base load generation.",
        "Flexible cycling options - The CAES plant allows for independent operation of the compression and expansion systems, allowing for simultaneous load absorption and balancing.\n",
        "Flexible cycling options - The CAES plant allows for independent operation of the compression and expansion systems, allowing for simultaneous load absorption and balancing.",
        "Generation efficiency - Relatively flat heat rate across all operating ranges, thus overall generation efficiency is near the same at 10 percent as it is at 100 percent.\n",
