        "Driving the performance and efficiency of paper productions to the max",
        "The paper industry is facing challenges that could not be more contradictory. While investment budgets are under constant pressure, customers all over the world are demanding product quality that's virtually impossible to achieve using outdated technology. At the same time, continuously growing expenses for energy and raw materials are dramatically increasing cost pressures, while the competition is getting more and more aggressive. To master these challenges, we've developed innovative drive solutions for all pulp and paper processes, from front to end and for all needs: individual or sectional drive systems with full automation and digitalization support to simplify operations, optimize diagnostic capabilities, meet the highest safety standards, maximize efficiency, and minimize maintenance costs.",
        "If the product quality demanded in international competition can't be achieved with existing technologies, budgets are under cost pressure, and the cost of energy and raw materials are increasing, there's only one solution that makes sense: increase system performance with specific investments in your control technology and in modern, energy-efficient drive technology. Gearless drives, permanent magnet motors to save energy and space around the machine or both - we can supply a solution to suit your needs",
        "Our innovative drive solutions, Industrial Process Control Suite, for all speed variable drives will handle all the challenges of the fiber industry or other porcess industries. The module is based on SIMATIC PCS 7, the leading process control system worldwide. It perfectly integrates the functionality of the drives to create a powerful system with highest availability relieving the operator from many tasks by intelligent functionality tailored to the specific area of the porcess. Our solution will help to reach the goals: producing a top-quality product realiably ad cost-effectivly. ",
        "The automation controller ensures the functionality of rapid digital control and calculation tasks for the drives. The operator interface is available as a high-end operator station in a virtualized server-client architecture for control and monitoring, including comprehensive fault diagnostics. Operator panels provide a user-friendly solution for local operation. Together with our partners we can provide the complete solution for you, from sesign and engineering, manufacturing and commissioning, for green and brown field plants and their complete lifecycle.",
        "With our proven and precisely coordinated components and standardized technology modules, you can also integrate higher-value control functions with minimum engineering effort. And with the industry-specific control and diagnostic functions of Industrial Process Control Suite Sectoinal Drive System, you'll also benefit from high-availability paper production with optimal quality across all plant components, from the paper machine to the finishing machine and reel slitter. Safety integrated is an integral part, which complies with all legal and the most advanced safety requirements such as EN1034 and EU Regulation of Machinery.",
        "Industrial Process Control Suite Sectional Drives System APL for sectional drive systems optimizes process observation and monitoring",
        "Achieving consistent paper quality with continuously increasing throughput and a greater diversity of grades are central challenges for the pulp and paper industry. To meet these challenges, the functional modules of the Advanced Process Library offer open-ended, modular drive solutions. The range of applications of extends from partial modernization to complete turnkey solutions. Whether it’s through improved automation on the basis of SIMATIC PCS 7, by using more energy-efficient SINAMICS drives, standard geared or gearless drive trains, induction or permanent magnet synchronous motors – with our library, you can bring your plants up to peak performance, a solution that also minimizes maintenance costs.",
        "With our design of cabinets for varibale speed drives, you can hat ir all: Safe operation due to the separation of power and control electronics into different cabinets, high flexibuility of products or options, efficient operation and maintenance. Designed to be buil everywhere close to you, no matter where your are.",
        "The fiber industry involves extremely complex workflows, and the drive technology can't afford to have any weak points. The utmost emphasis is placed on minimizing potential risks for humans, plants, and the environment using technical resources, with no negative impacts on the production process. That's why safety is an essential aspect of individual or sectional drive systems. Choose our solution for the safety of your drive.",
        "Using a patent-pending procedure, Safety Integrated offers you the solution to meet the terms of European Union Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC as well as EU Regulation of Machinery 2923/1230 and all EN 1034 requirements with no additional hardware: seamlessly integrated safety technology embedded in the drive automation. The solution is implemented in the proven fail-safe control unit S7-410. PROFIsafe is implemented for fail-safe communication with SINAMICS frequency converters from Siemens AG or with other manufacturer's drive products. By offering Safe Limited Speed (SLS) using standard components, easy selection of operating modes at operator panels and WinCC stations, and integrated diagnostics via the existing operating system, you're ideally prepared for a safe operation. Safety Integrated is an integral part of our proven, future-proof solutions.",
        "Our Industry Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle.",
        "Any questions about drive technology? Let our fiber industry experts help you to find the optimal solution for your specific requirements.",
