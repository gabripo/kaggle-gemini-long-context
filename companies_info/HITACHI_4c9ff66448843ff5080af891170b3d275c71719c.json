        "Hitachi Energy's GIS can be equipped with control, protection and communication feature for smooth integration into substation automation systems using IEC 61850. \n\r\nFor connection to the IEC 61850-9-2 process bus, low-power instrument transformer (LPIT) for GIS with merging units are used for sampled values for protection and metering. Alternatively, SAM600 stand-alone merging units can be connected to conventional current or voltage transformers of the GIS.\n\r\nHitachi Energy's Relion® series are used for protection, control, measurement and supervision. SF6 density in the GIS is supervised by modular switchgear monitoring (MSM) device while Switchsync™  PWC600 point-on-wave controllers are used for controlled switching and circuit breaker monitoring. Circuit breaker and gas density monitoring data can additionally be accessed via embedded web servers. All these features use IEC 61850 communication protocols at the process and station bus. \n\r\n In our GIS product line, digital monitoring, measurement, control and protection based on IEC 61850 can be integrated into the local control  cubicle (LCC) within the bay. Hitachi Energy Relion series of protection and control IEDs allow the flexible combinations of control and functionality in one device. ",
