        "Standardized traction voltages are 750 V DC, 1500 V DC and 3000 V DC. \n\nThe three-phase voltage from the local utility is stepped down and rectified in the traction substations to provide the required DC voltage. \n\nHitachi Energy portfolio covers the complete scope starting from the optimized grid connection down to the conductor rail or overhead line: ",
        "Special emphasis is placed on  optimizing the footprint of the substations. Hitachi Energy addresses this requirement with pre-fabricated steel frame (container) buildings or off-the-shelf concrete buildings, allowing for a compact design and a high degree of integration. These pre-fabricated and transportable substations contain all main equipment, station auxiliaries  and the station control system. \n",
