        "Modern energy systems are being impacted by the reduction of nuclear and fossil power generation as well as the increase of renewable power generation. These factors can cause stability problems in the HV-grid (reduction of short circuit power/ inertia and voltage dip stability) which might result in a blackout. In order to prevent this, power stations with black start capabilities are required, while synchronous condensers can supply power during short circuits, and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control. ",
        "A synchronous condenser is a generator without a prime mover from a gas or steam turbine. It stabilizes the grid in changing reactive power demands. The rotating mass and the dynamic generation of reactive power stands for the high advantages of this product. The main benefits of a synchronous condenser are frequency stabilization and power supply during short circuits. ",
        "Any existing power plant generator type can be converted into a synchronous condenser. It can supply the grid with short circuit power and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control. Synchronous condensers are designed to stabilize frequency and maintain voltage even over long distances. ",
        "They can generate electricity during dynamic peak demands and are able to build up the grid after a black-out. The project time for converting a plant is usually less than 12 months. The solution allows the use of existing assets and offers a very short return on investment (ROI).",
        " Minimum costs due to re-use of the existing generator and relevant auxiliary systems. Written-off assets can be reactivated.",
        " Extended lifetime of a power plant generates additional revenue.",
        " Decreased risk of blackouts as grid is in an optimum range of operation ",
        "Black start capabilities can be built by using an independent power source to restore the plant's auxiliary systems without an external source of supply.",
        "Suitable technologies are:",
        "  The process begins with a feasibility study in which the main generator capabilities and grid requirements are assessed. The next steps include integrating the new power source into the plant and making necessary modifications to the existing installation.",
        " Availability to start-up the power plant without an external power supply  ",
        " Capability to help restore power to a national grid in the event of a total or partial shutdown  ",
        " Provision of start-up power to other power stations as the system restoration progresses  ",
        " Additional revenues received directly from the TSOs can help increase plant profitability through additional functionality and revenue opportunities and avoid the closing down of the plant  ",
        " Avoidance of huge production losses due to blackouts and equipment being unavailable  ",
