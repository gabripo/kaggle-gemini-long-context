        "Cybersecurity has become a critical aspect of the power industry’s grid modernization. Today’s electric energy automation and operational technology (OT) control systems interconnect with multiple networks, systems, and locations, which has increased operational efficiencies tremendously. However, these interconnected digital system also has introduced cybersecurity concerns previously known only to office or enterprise IT systems. Furthermore, global challenges - such as more published vulnerabilities, a growing number of cybersecurity incidents targeting industrial control systems, and the increase in digitalization - have made it more complex to secure the electric energy OT automation and control system infrastructure.",
        "When it comes to cybersecurity, the primary focus is on understanding cyberthreats and risk management. At Hitachi Energy, we are guided by the following principles: there is no such thing as 100 percent cybersecurity, and cybersecurity is not a fixed destination but an evolving target from new threats and bad actors.",
        "Hitachi Energy’s end-to-end cybersecurity solutions assess risks wherever they arise, from control centers to communications networks to substation automation systems. We develop highly secure, trusted cybersecurity solutions for industrial and electric energy OT infrastructure, and mission-critical environments. Our evolving innovative product and system solutions place the highest priority on reliability and security.",
        "Cybersecurity is an integral part of product development at Hitachi Energy. From the outset, our grid automation products are designed with comprehensive, cybersecure measures. We have a well-defined Security Development Lifecycle program and implement multiple secure processes, including handling requirements, security training for software developers, threat modeling, in-house and external security testing. Our reliable, secure customer solutions also include built-in security features, such as individual user accounts and detailed security event logs.",
        "When delivering a system, threaded throughout the project lifecycle, the project organization is responsible for the cybersecurity of our system delivery. Project execution embeds cybersecurity within processes during the design, engineering, acceptance testing, and commissioning phases. This approach is designed to deliver critical infrastructure solutions with the appropriate security properties and to securely execute projects. ",
        "Hitachi Energy's cybersecurity posture during testing and commissioning addresses cybersecurity in lifetime support services and future product adaptations, which includes implementing processes to resolve problems that might arise after product release. Read more here.",
        "Hitachi Energy provides several offerings to help you manage the risks of cybersecurity exposure throughout the life of your industrial automation and control system:  \n",
        "ASSESS: Hitachi Energy carries out a cybersecurity assessment and an interview with you to understand your processes and procedures. A detailed cybersecurity assessment report is then produced and provided to you along with a set of recommended actions for improved cybersecurity specific to your system.",
