        "Hitachi Energy's efficient and reliable synchronous condenser system supports the grid with short-circuit power capacity, inertia, and reactive power to balance voltage fluctuations and minimize disturbance during fault conditions. High LVRT capacity ensures short-circuit power in the grid during extremely low voltage conditions. ",
        "The fast and compact solution, cutting-edge technology, and fully compatible control equipment deliver the best performance and optimum cost efficiency with extremely low harmonic emissions. The control system manages to regulate the connection point on the HV side of the step-up transformer and not only on ma-chine terminals, making the reference setting easier for the user.",
        "Hitachi Energy's synchronous condenser system cover 10 - 200 MVAr range with single-machine solutions. Installation of larger machines or when 100% redundancy is required, a multi-machine installation with coor-dinated control can be installed. This solution is based on a modular concept.",
        "To ensure enduring and reliable operation, our synchronous condensers are designed for high reliability, du-rability, and the capability to operate for long periods between recommended service intervals. Hitachi Energy bases its solution on brushless synchronous machines with pony motor start. This setup reduces maintenance and gives a simple and reliable start/stop procedure.",
        "Hitachi Energy's Power Quality and Power Consulting departments, with extensive experience in solving power quality issues for different kinds of customers around the world, can support in defining the exact configuration and size of the required compensation system. Our delivery capabilities include Synchronous Condenser Systems as well as, hybrid configurations with STATCOMs, which are optimal solutions when short circuit and inertia issues are combined with other power quality challenges. ",
        "We can provide up to the complete engineering package, including installation and commissioning of the whole system, starting with simulation models and studies, which are increasingly important with the new challenges in the transmission systems, and concluding with the final site acceptance test.",
