        "content": "    \n \n \n  \nDesign options for wind \nenergy tenders  \n \nDecember  2015  \n \n \n2 \n Introduction  \n \nThe Guidelines on  State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 -2020 indicate an \nevolution towards tendering (competitive bidding) as a reference system for public support \nallocation to renewable generators from 2017 .  \n \nThe pro per design of tenders is of utmost importance to sustain wind energy’s growth path: wind \npower is currently the generating technology with the highest rate for new installations in 2014 \n(43.7%)1. Installed wind power capacity is expected to  reach 320GW in 2030, producing 778TWh \nof electricity that will cover 23 % of the EU’s electricity demand2. \n \nIn this document , EWEA aims to provide an overview of existing tender schemes  and lessons \nlearned from their implementation. EWEA hereafter outlines the considerati ons that national \nauthorities need to take into account when setting up a tender system.  \n \nBackground   \n \nThe objective of the wind industry is to be competitive in a well-functioning  electricity market , \ndelivering the benefits of wind energy in the most aff ordable way. Investments made possible by \nlong-term volume targets supported by dynamic  support mechanisms drive down costs and help \nminimi se the need for  specific support.  \n \nThe industry, therefore, believes that tenders may be considered as a support  allocation \nmechanism provided  they are designed properly and allow for the cost effective  deployment of \nwind energy . Tenders can  help minimise  abrupt or retroactive changes in national markets as \nthey provide a  long-term  support mechanism  to investors .  \n \nHowev er, e xperience shows that the effectiveness of tenders lies very much in the details of the \ndesign. Due to the limited European and international experience with tendering, public \nauthorities will seek the appropriate tender format on a learning -by-doing b asis thus challenging \nthe industry (developers, financing institutions, etc.) to adapt wind business models to constantly \nevolving tender arrangements.  Tenders present participants with higher risks (costly applications, \nuncertainty over project selection and guaranteed remuneration) which are internali sed in bids \nand could result in higher support costs.  \n \nSerious shortcomings associated with tenders in the past included : \n Investor uncertainty over the price deterred investment;  \n Investors bidding too low to  ensure they won the tender were not able to develop the project \nas the economics did not guarantee sufficient returns;  \n Complex tender procedures and financial risks discouraged small players from participating;  \n Sites selected without regard for environme ntal impacts resulted in public opposition and/or \nundesired environmental consequences leading to project being blocked;  \n Sites selected with little regard for territorial distribution led to certain areas or regions being \nover-solicited whilst others ignor ed; \n Where there was little or no competition, there was no incentive to lower prices.  \n \nThere is no tender design system that is a complete success story because tenders are subject to \ncontinuous adaptation of both design elements and participants behavior . For a tender to be \neffective , it has to achieve competitive prices (cost -competitiveness criterion ) and high realisation \nrates (efficiency criterion ). Tenders should also incentivise re search and innovation efforts and \nallow  for the development of cuttin g-edge wind technologies.  \n                                                        \n1 EWEA, Wind in power – 2014 European statistics , February 2015  \n2 EWEA, Wind energy scenarios for 2030 , August 2015  \n \n3 \n  \nWhereas the State aid guidelines consider tenders as an effective and  cost-efficient instrument  \nfor allocating public support to renewable  energy , it is noteworthy that tenders do not necessarily \nfit with all market situations a nd do not always generate the lowest levelised cost of electricity \n(LCOE ). Tenders should be considered as one amongst numerous  support mechanism design  \noptions rather than as a silver bullet  for reducing renewable energy  support . Member States \nshould have  enough flexibility in applying the State aid guidelines’ provisions by determining  \nwhether the market is sufficiently liquid and whether there is a homogenous bidding structure \nallowing for effective tendering. If that is not the case, Member States shoul d allocate support  \noutside of the tender process as per the opt -outs provided by the State aid guidelines.  \n \nState aid guidelines : caveats to tendering principle   \n \nUnder Article 126, Member States may opt -out from  tendering in the following cases:  \n- Only o ne or very limited number of projects  or sites could be eligible;  \n- Tendering woul d lead to higher support levels;  \n- Tendering would result in low project realization  rates . \n \nThe Guidelines prescribe for technology -neutral tenders unless they lead to a sub -optimal result in \nview of:  \n- The longer -term potential of a given new and innovative technology ; \n- The need to achieve diversification ; \n- Network constraints and grid stability ; \n- System (integration) costs;  \n- Need to avoid distortions on the raw material markets from  biomass support . \n \nArticle 127 provides a “de minimi s” rule  which exempts wind installations with an installed capacity \nof up to 6 MW or 6 generation units, and demonstration projects from tendering.  \n \n \nNo-regret tender principles  \n \nWhile the need for fle xibility in implementing the State aid guidelines should be respected, the \nindustry has identified a number of non -regret options to be considered when setting up a tender.  \n \n \n Prior to setting up a tender mechanism, n ational authorities  must:  \n- Provide the necessary policy framework, including long -term renewable deployment targets \nand trajectories as well as budget allocations for renewable energy support ;  \n- Perform a thorough assessment of the state of play of the industry, supply chains, power \ntechnology m ix, strategic potential of a given technology for a specific market, deployable \ncapacity, deployment constrai nts; \n- Carefully consider whether tenders are best suited to achieve overall policy objectives and fit \nwith national market circumstances.  \n \n The intr oduction of t endering systems should not result in  any retroactive changes to existing \nsupport mechanisms . A sufficient transition period is necessary to allow industry players to \nadapt as well as t o avoid market standstill . One way to allow for such an ad aptation could be \nto entitle projects from the old regime  to opt for the new one (e.g.  Poland ).  \n \n Tenders should be organis ed on a regular basis , at reasonable notice and should provide  \nvisibility on the  size and overall budget  to be awarded  over multiple years . Avoiding stop -and-\n \n4 \n go bidding rounds decreases  risk premiums, attracts bidders and allows for greater price \nreduction.  \n \n In general, t enders are better suited for larger markets  with a high diversity of players . A large \nnumber of participants can resu lt in competition, real price discovery and cost -reduction.   \n \n The tender procedure should  be fully  transparent and open to as many  participants as \npossible. Material and financial p requalification criteria as well as penalties need to be well \ncalibrated  in order to allow a variety of credible players to participate in the bidding process.  \n \n Prototype technologies should be exempted from tendering. A separate budget needs to be \nset in order to incentivise technology innovation and cost reductions.   \n \n Tender s should provide separate baskets and budgets for deployed and less deployed \ntechnologies  in order to properly take into consideration their specific characteristics and \ncost profiles.  \n \n The contracted energy volumes in a tender procedure should, preferabl y, be purchased by a \nsingle and credit -worthy offtaker.  \n \n Tender design should ensure coordination between different administrative levels \nresponsible for renewable projects deployment. Streamlining p lanning and permitting \nprocedures will decrease  transact ion costs , ensure better territorial distribution of pro jects \nand could contribute to diminish public  opposition to wind projects.  \n \n No one -size-fits-all tender scheme exists. Additional experi ence with tenders will be required  \nto provide for an optimal de sign on a case -by-case basis. Tenders should therefore not be \nconsidered as the only option for allocating public support to renewable energy generators.  \n \n \n5 \n Overview of design options   \n \nItem  Options  Assessment  \nTENDER FRAMEWORK  \n \n \n \n \nTender \norgani sation  and \nsite selection  Centralised approach whereby \npublic authorities select wind sites \nand openly provide information to \nall interested parties prior to the \ntender launch.   The centralised approach could simplif y the \nadministrative procedures for wind project \ndevelopers and reduce s transaction costs. A \none-stop-shop arrangement could  facilitate the \nenvironmental licensing procedures, permits \nand land management.  \nDecentralised (cluster) approach \nwhereby several developers \npropose sites that compete for \npublic  support among themselves  Tendering greenfield sites in a cluster approach \nleaves the pre -development work (e.g. natural \nendowment assessment) and site selection to \ndevelopers, who are also responsible for \nsecuring land ownership rights, permits and grid \nconnection.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPre-qualification \ncriteria  Material pre-qualification  criteria \n(preliminary licenses, land permits, \ngrid connection, etc.)  \n Pre-qualification criteria  affect the cost of \nparticipating in a tender  as well as the ability of \na bidder t o take a project through completion. \nThey should therefore be well balanced in order \nnot to deter investors at an ear ly stage of the \ntender process  but also to ensure that credible \nplayers participate in the process.  \n \nProject -related pre -qualification cri teria  are best \nsuited to ensure a variety of players can \nparticipate  in the tender process.  \nFinancial pre-qualification criteria \n(Bid bonds, project finance track  \nrecord, etc.)  \n Bid bonds are paid by all  participants or only \nfrom the s uccessful bidders  to prove their \ncommitment in constructing the project. Upon \ntimely completion of the submitted offer, \ninvestors recover the whole amount of the bid \nbond, but i n case of delays, some of it is \nretained. Defining the right level of the bid bond \ncan be challe nging: if too high, it increases \nprojects’ risk premiums and pushes away \npotential participants; if too low, implementation \nrates will be diminished. In case of very strict \nmaterial  pre-qualification rules, bid bond \nrequirements could be relaxed.  \n \n6 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPenalties   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTermination of awarded contract , \nlowering of support levels , etc.  \n Penalties should be well calibrated in order to \nattract competent bidders and maximise rates \nof implementation.  \n \nIn case of too low pre -qualification criteria and \nthe absence of penalties, developers would be \nable to withdraw from projects without \nconsequences making the tender inefficient. \nPenalties should be high enough to incentivi se \nserious bidders but not too rigid to turn away \npotential participants.  \n \nPenalties  should be able to distribute the \nproject risks between involved stakeholders and \ndifferentiate between delays originating from \nproject developers and those stemming from \npublic authorities (e.g. delays in licensing \nprocedures) or external factors (e.g.  changes in \ncommodity prices ). Deadlines for building the \nprojects are another way to ensure higher \nimplementation rates provided that lead times \nare technology -specific  and reasonable . \n \n \n \n \n \nRemunerated \nproduct  Remunerating  capacity (EUR/MW)  \n Capacity paymen ts reward bidders with a fixed \npayment independent of the power production. \nDefining an adequate capacity payment level is \nchallenging as it need to be high enough to \ncover, together with the market price, the \noverall cost of the project .  \nRemunerating  energy (EUR/MWh)  \n Energy  payments grant bidders with a fixed \npayment for the power produced. They are \ncurrently better suited to reward the most \nefficient p layers and allow for the maximis ation \nof wind production.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBands  Technology -neutral whereby  all \ntechnologies compete on par  \n Technology -neutral tenders grant support only to \nthe least -cost technology options thus creating \nlow technology diversification and excluding \ntechnologies with cost reduction potential (e.g. \noffshore wind).  \n \nOften, they t end to separate the auctioned \nproduct into baskets whose definition is crucial \nin creating competition and liquidity among \navailable technology options. Therefore, \ndesigning a technology -neutral tender in a clear, \ntransparent and non -discriminatory manner is a \nchallenging task given the specific \ncharacteristics of different generation \ntechnologies . \nTechnology -specific whereby \ntechnologies are differentiated  To ensure security of supply and system stability \nthere is a need for a variety of technologies and  \nnot just the least cost ones. Technology -specific \ntenders better allow policy makers to design a \nspecific generation mix fitting with national \nresource endowment. Moreover, different \ntechnologies production characteristics and cost \nprofiles require differ ent auction features in \n \n7 \n order to provide a level -playing field and non -\ndiscriminatory treatment in the tender process.  \nTENDER PROCEDURE  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrice -finding  \nmechanism  Sealed -bid: bids are submitted \nsimultaneously and remain \nundisclosed  \n Sealed -bid is a static auction because no \nexchange of information occurs about the price \nof the auctioned product. In theory, information \nasymmetry might result in the “winner’s curse” \nwhereby the winner underestimates the true \nvalue of the auctioned product, und erbids in \norder to win but ends up with an unprofitable \nprice. However, sealed -bid offers low \ntransaction costs and is simple which attracts \nparticipants.  \nIterative process: either descending \nor ascending clock where the \nauctioneer establishes a price \nceiling, which decreases/increases \nduring the iterative bidding process, \nuntil a bidder accepts to procure at \na certain price level  \n Iterative bidding procedures are dynamic \nauctions whereby participants gradually unveil \ntheir offers and can adapt them to th eir \ncompetitors’ bids. In theory, the possibility of \nmisjudging the true value of the auctioned \nproduct, resulting in winner’s curse, decreases. \nHowever, iterative bidding could potentially \ninvolve strategic behavior. A descending clock is \nmost commonly us ed but competition levels \ndepend upon the ceiling price. If the ceiling \nprice is too low, only a small number of bidders \nwill participate, consequently leading to \nundersupply and lack of competition. If it is too \nhigh, there is a risk of opportunistic bidd ing. \nHybrid: two -stage auction \ncombining descending -clock with \nsealed -bid  Hybrid auctions  provide for price discovery \nduring the descending clock at the first tender \nstage and participants preserve the \nconfidentiality of their bids during a second \nseale d-bid round. However, th is arrangement is \nquite complex to administer.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPayment \narrangement  Pay-as-bid: each bidder receives \nthe price he has offered  \n Pay-as-bid could minimi se overall policy costs \nbecause bidders only receive the minimum \nsupport requ ested for projects. In theory, \nhowever, it might result in low realisation rates \ndue to opportunistic bidding.  \nPay-as-clear (uniform/marginal \npricing): all bidders receive the \nprice set by the most expensive \naccepted bid (marginal price)  Under uniform p ricing, bidders may have an \nincentive to disclose real costs because the final \ncompensation is not linked to individual bids. In \ntheory, strategic bidding could occur as \nparticipants bid low hoping to get higher \nremuneration than needed if the marginal pri ce \nexceeds their offers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n Tender systems  for onshore wind  \n \nOut of the 128.8 GW of wind energy capacity  installed by end -2014 , the bulk – 120.6 GW3 comes \nfrom onshore.  Onshore wind installations are expected to  reach 254 GW in 2030 covering 16.7% \nof the EU electricity demand4. The technology has already reached cost-competitiveness with \nconventional power generation  (once carbon costs  and external costs  are internalised)  in \nGermany and the UK  in the second half of 20155.  \n \nOnshore wind is a particularl y chal lenging technology for tendering because of the complex \nproject development process, the involvement of various permitting authorities and the need for \nlocal acceptance .  \n \nConsidera tions   \n \n1. Technology -neutral versus  technology -specific  tender s  \n \nWhile in principle onshore wind can successfully compete in technology -neutral tenders (e.g. UK) \nin many cases, a t echnology -specific approach may be more appropriate to take into account \nparticular  situations  (absence of homogeneous bidding structure)  and priorities  (local player \ninvolvement)  at the national level . In a number of leading onshore markets (e.g. Germany , Spain, \nItaly)  such considerations include setting up a realistic annual deployment target that includes \nboth new installation potential and r epowering needs of the wind generation fleet .  \n \n2. Tender rewarding energy (EUR/MWh)   \n \nOnshore wind tenders should , at least in the short -term,  remunerate energy produced \n(EUR/MWh). The awarded product should offer a long -term investment signal that provid e \ninvestors with visibility over future revenues and to subsequently diminish risk and lower prices \nduring the bidding process.  \n \n3. Decentralised site selection  \n \nGiven the decreasing availability of high resource onshore sites, project  developers  are bes t \nsuited to use their know -how in  identify ing good sites for onshore deployment . Streamlining \nplanning and l icensing procedures should be a priority for national authorities as the numerous \npermits required impede project development.  \n \n4. Level -playing fie ld for local/community actors  \n \nTenders tend to favor large professional players  over smaller actors who cannot bear too \nstringent econ omic prequalification criteria  and are subject to higher risk premiums. Smaller \nactors involvement in onsho re wind deploy ment can play an important role to help counteract \nlocal acceptance issues.  \n \nTherefore, pre -qualification criteria should be project -related (provision of building consent, grid -\naccess connection, land acquisition) rather than bidder -specific (experience,  project portfolio) to \nensure small players participation. Entry barriers for s maller players could be relaxed  via the \napplication of “de -minimis” rule s. Bid bond requirements should be set at a reasonable level to \nensure that smaller, yet credible , player s can participate in the tender process.  \n \n                                                        \n3 EWEA, Wind in power – 2014 European statistics , Februa ry 2015  \n4 EWEA, Wind energy scenarios for 2030 , August 2015  \n5 BNEF, Levelised Cost of Electricity Update – H2 2015. In Germany, onshore cos ts $80/MWh compared to gas at $118/MWh and \ncoal at $106/MWh. In the UK, onshore costs $85/MWh compared to $115 for CCGT and $115 for coal -fired installations.   \n \n9 \n National Tender Experiences in Onshore Wind  \n \nItaly  \n \nTendering \nperiod  2013  2014  2015   \nTender \nschedule  1 per year  \nAvailable \nbudget  €5.8 bn annual cumulative spending limit for RES support ( excluding  solar PV ) \nTendered \nproduct  Capacity  \nSupport \nmechanism  CfD (fixed price)  \nTender \ndesign  Technology -specific (quotas set for onshore wind above 5 MW)  \nSealed -bid (participants submit a discount to a reference tariff)  \nMW \ntendered  500 MW  400 MW  356 MW  \nParticipants  18 47 61 \nProject \ndelivery  30% delivered  \nAward and \ncompliance \ncriteria   For plants up to 20 MW, only an env ironmental evaluation required;

Offshore wind installed capacity is expected to grow from 8GW by the end of 2014 to \n66GW in 2030  cover ing 7.7% of the EU electricity demand 15. \nThe offshore wind sector provides valuable insight into how existing tender systems have been \nset up and deployed.  Within the Member States with offshore wind markets, Denmark and the \nUK have tenders in operation, with the tenders rolling out in the Netherlands and a tender system \nbeing tabled in Germany.  \nConsiderations  \nThe scale of developments and investment requir ed to develop offshore wind requires unique \nconsiderations that may not apply for onshore or other renewable energy technologies.  \n1. Centralised or decentrali sed allocation  \nWhilst centralised site allocation is not appropriate for onshore wind, the system ex ists in \noffshore wind for Denmark, whilst the UK has adopted a decentrali sed system. The Netherlands \nare starting a centralised allocation system in 2016 (Borselle) . Both systems have shown to \nreduce costs over time. It should be noted that the UK places p re-planning and transmission \ncosts onto the developer, meaning that UK tender prices are higher than Danish tender results. \nHowever, the UK system does allow for greater competition  in terms of the scope and the cost of \nenergy revealed in the tender result  is mor e transparent in the UK as fewer costs  are sociali sed. \nA centralised system places a degree of emphasis on government to determine the sites to enter \nfor tendering. Site selection should ultimately b e an exercise decided by organis ations best \nequipp ed to assess resource and general technical viability. Governments can instead focus on \nstreamlined administrative procedures  to process permits for project development in a timely \nmanner.  A one -stop-shop approach is advisable in order to ensure efficient coordination between \nthe responsible authorities. An advantage of centralis ed planning is that grid connection of \nseveral wind farms can be planned centrally, which opens the scope for grid synergies.  \n2. Pre-Qualification Criteria and Penalties  \nWhen conductin g a tender for sites at significant scale, governments should rightly implement \npre-checks and penalties to ensure that a bidder has the resources to see a project through to \ncompletion.  However, overly strict criteria and penalties can harm the effectiven ess of reaching a \ncompetitive price for the project by unnecessarily excluding sets of investors or developers.  \nThis has been a critical point for offshore wind where the scale of investment naturally limits \nparticipation, but a point that should be consi dered with more mature technologies where a \nlarger pool of market players exist. A careful blend of financial and technical criteria, and project \nmilestones should be designed in any tender system with the size and maturity of the market in \nmind.  \n3. Technolog y-specific  tenders  \nTechnology -specific tenders are best suited for offshore wind in order to capitali se on its specific \ngeneration characteristics and to tap into its cost reduction potential.   \n                                                        \n14 EWEA, The Europea n offshore wind industry – key trends and statistics 1st half 2015 , July 2015  \n15 EWEA, Wind energy scenarios for 2030 , August 2015  \n \n  \n  Offshore Wind Tender Scheme Designs  \nUnited Kingdom  \nRelevant  \nauthorities  Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)  \nOverall framework  Electricity Market Reform (EM R)  \nNational target for \noffshore wind  None  \nSupport \nMechanism  CfD - Contracts for Difference  \nFeed -in premium  \nA 'top -up to wholesale' capped at strike price  \nPrice \nDetermination  Highest bid in delivery year for sites leased by The Crown Estate  \n \nPay-as-clear \nOpen/Sealed bid  Sealed -bid \nInflation correction  Yes, CPI  \nIncome \nassessment  Hourly average price  \nQuantity of \nSupport  15 years from commissioning in target delivery window  \nDefined Schedule \nfor allocation? \n(Y/N)  Yearly - but current allocation on hold  \nRemuneration \nbudget  Constrained Allocation Rounds (Application windows, with expectation \nof rationing)  \nQualification \nCriteria    \nFinancial  Prequalification proof of:  \n- Incorporation to relevant tax jurisdiction . \nPost CfD contract allocation:  \n- Evidence of Substantial Financial Commitment to be provided at  \nkey milestones;  \n- Proof of 10% of capital costs spent via invoices OR poof of major \nconstruction contracts signed  by one year after CfD contract \nsignature ; \n- Major const ruction contracts signed;  \n- FID / Financin g secured as evidenced by signed loan agreement;  \n \n 17 - Crown Estate Lease signed;  \n- Energy Yield Assessment;  \n- Key project consents . \nTechnical  Prequalification criteria:  \nPlanning permiss ion has been secured either by:  \n- Development consent from Secretary of S tate (Pl anning Act \n2008);  \n- Section 36 Consen t (Electricity Act 1989);  \n- Order from Welsh Ministers under the  Transport and Works Act \n1992;  \n- A Grid Conne ction Offer has been accepted;  \n- Government certificate issued which validates supply chain plan \n(for projects over 30 0MW) . \n \nPost CfD contract allocation : \n- Project at least 80% commissioned within Target Commissioning \nWindow (TCW) for difference payments to be triggered, starting 15 \nyear term.
