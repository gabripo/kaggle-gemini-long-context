        "Intelligently tackling market challenges with optimized processes and improved quality ",
        "The cost pressures, increased quality requirements, environmental regulations, lower margins, and intense competition in the fiber industry call for intelligent solutions in the area of automation. Our custom-built automation solutions are key to meeting these market challenges. They provide maximum data transparency throughout the entire production process as well as systematic quality assurance and simple operation. What’s more, they're the very foundation for the digital enterprise – for a faster, more flexible, and more intelligent production despite the rapidly changing paper market.",
        "The seamless integration of individual control modules is the special strength of the SE Industrial Process Control Suite. The Distributed Control System (DCS) SIMATIC PCS 7 is used as the backbone for the mill’s automation system. With modules for process control & safety, all process areas from the mill can be monitored and control in real-time with the highest reliability and availability. ",
        "Siemens Energy, a recognized provider of integrated solutions, embraces the Main Automation and Electrical Contractor (MAEC) approach.",
        "Unleash the full potential of your pulp and paper production process with the SE Industrial Process Control Suite, enabling seamless deliveries for all critical process areas, including wood preparation, pulp production, stock preparation, bleaching, paper production, chemical recovery, and water treatment.",
        "Experience unparalleled efficiency and control at every stage of production, ensuring optimized performance and productivity throughout your operation.",
        "From design, integration, project management to managed lifecycle services.",
        "Integral automation solutions instead of costly system diversity",
        "Using different systems in the automation architecture creates interface problems as well as increased training, maintenance, and operating costs. To avoid this, you have to move away from island solutions toward integrated automation on a standard system platform. Our decentralized Process Control and Safety System offers you a scalable, uniform, integrated automation system from the field level all the way to the ERP level. Process Control and Safety System is based on SIMATIC PCS 7, the foremost automation system on the global market, and is supplemented by ready-made, coordinated software modules that we developed specifically for the pulp and paper industry alongside our customers. Using identical components and well-thought-out solutions for the drive, automation, and quality systems facilitates the complete integration of all parts. And the incorporation of all levels from the field to production control provides unprecedented data transparency and diagnostics options that result in optimized processes and reduced downtime.",
