        "Having greater flexibility in the maintenance and particularly in the overhaul of gas turbines to suit customers operating profiles and budgets is vital. Siemens Energy is pleased to announce the release of additional three-tiered overhauls for TB gas turbines and expanding its overhaul portfolio.",
        "As the TB product line matures, we have acknowledged the need for a more flexible approach to maintenance, particularly to the overhauls of these units. We have released three additional overhaul levels, Bronze, Silver, and Gold to expand our overhaul portfolio. These new overhaul levels cover the gap between strip, clean and inspection, and the standard factory overhaul to give more flexibility to your operations.",
        "Applicable to TB5000 and TB5400 only.",
