        "Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) is the latest technology within our industry and is very similar to Resin Impregnated Paper (RIP) technology with one exception. Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings.",
