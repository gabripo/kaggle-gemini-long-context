        "A “footprint” turbine is a replacement turbine which does not require any significant modifications to be made to the existing base frame or foundation. The existing oil system, gearbox and driven machine (generator, compressor, etc.) can also continue to be used with no, or only minor ones. If necessary, they can be adapted to the new operating parameters.",
        "A “revamp” is the replacement of the steam path for optimization of turbine performance. ",
        "Other Modernization & Upgrades portfolio products include technical studies, energy studies, heat cycle optimization, T&T valves, control upgrades, and rotor dynamic analysis.",
