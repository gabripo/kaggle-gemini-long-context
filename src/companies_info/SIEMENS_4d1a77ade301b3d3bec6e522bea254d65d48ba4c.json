        "Heat decarbonization, also known as heat transition, is a process for reducing CO₂ emissions from heat production. As a first step, this can be achieved by making fuel usage more efficient. Later, this fossil fuel can be replaced with carbon-free fuel. Alternatively, heat production can also be electrified by using power from renewable energy. Existing heat networks can be transformed fast and at a large scale into cost-effective and flexible low-carbon energy systems.",
        "There are several applications that can help you to decarbonize heat networks. At Siemens Energy, we provide tailor-made CHP and Power to Heat (P2H) solutions for residential, commercial, or industrial sectors.",
        "CHP generates electricity and heat from a single fuel source. Traditional heating plants emit varying amounts of CO2 depending on the fuel used. Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%. Additionally, converting the plant into a GT-powered CHP or a Combined Cycle Power Plant with heat extraction can significantly improve its electrical efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency can be as high as 90% while using as little fuel as possible.",
        "Find out which gas turbine fits best for your application.",
        "Power-to-heat (P2H) can be accomplished through heat pumps or electric boilers. Heat pumps utilize waste or environmental heat, raising its temperature with electricity. They produce the same heat using less electricity than electric boilers, leading to lower operational costs. Electric boilers require minimal capital investment and have quick installation. Induction-based technologies or innovative turboheaters are suitable for industrial processes requiring high temperatures.",

        "Clean fuels, such as green hydrogen or biofuels, can drastically lower CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for fossil fuels in gas turbines. This is an effective way to future proof a combined cycle power plant and maximize its life cycle. Find out how much carbon footprint you can reduce by burning green hydrogen in your gas turbine. Calculate your carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and cost-savings potential on carbon certificates.",
        "Calculate your CO₂ emission reduction potential",
        "Another decarbonization path is to transform fossil-fired heat generation by switching to sustainably produced biomass in Combined Heat and Power plants. When adding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), biomass- or biofuel-based CHP plants can be further transformed into bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), thus allowing for negative emissions and energy production at the same time.  ",

        "For maximum efficiency, it often makes sense to combine different technologies. To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H).",
        "As most of the factors influencing the technology choice depend on the location of the heating network, there is no one-fits-all solution. However, a pre-selection of suitable technologies can be done, based on the temperature level that is required for the specific application. The matrix below shows the temperature level that can be achieved with different technologies.",

        "Repurposing existing power plants or heating plants can substantially contribute to decarbonizing your assets. A heating plant can be transformed into a cogeneration plant, and a thermal power plant can be turned into a CHP plant. Alternatively, you can convert the complete thermal plant into a Power to Heat application.",
        "With our Brownfield transformation approach, you can convert existing assets within a short time frame into a low-carbon facility while re-using the existing infrastructure as much as possible.\n",
        "Power-to-heat (P2H) systems signal a paradigm shift in the capabilities of low-carbon energy systems. Since heat pumps or electric boilers can be exclusively powered by green electricity, it allows the integration of renewable energy sources in heat energy production—an integration that is both crucial and long overdue.",
        "By adjusting their heat output in response to variations in renewable energy generation, power-to-heat systems can also provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Power-to-heat systems convert surplus renewable energy into usable thermal energy for local or central heating and cooling needs.\n",
        "Due to their high Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat pumps provide low carbon heat. They are completely carbon neutral when powered entirely by renewable energy. ",
        "Heat can be stored significantly more cost effectively than electricity. The combination of P2H with CHP stabilizes the power market. Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time. At peak heat demand it is possible to operate the heat pump together with the CHP plant.",
