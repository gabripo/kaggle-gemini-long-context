        "Our DC transformers and reactor bushings are designed to provide reliable and efficient electrical insulation and connection for high-voltage DC transmission and distribution systems.",
        "Our DC transformers and reactor bushings are designed to provide reliable and efficient electrical insulation and connection for high-voltage DC transmission and distribution systems. They are typically installed on the wall or tank of the transformer or reactor and provide a safe and secure passage for the electrical conductor from the high-voltage equipment to the lower-voltage equipment.",
        "These bushings are designed to handle high voltage levels of up to 800 kV for DC transformers and 1100 kV for DC reactors, and high current levels, up to 10,000 A for DC transformers and 6,000 A for DC reactors. They use advanced materials, such as RIP (resin-impregnated paper) and silicone rubber, which offer low loss and high efficiency, reducing energy consumption and increasing cost savings.",
        "Hitachi Energy bushings for DC transformers and reactors are available in different sizes, shapes, and mounting options to meet specific customer requirements. They are also designed to have a long life span and require minimal maintenance, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. ",
        "No matter the issue, our teams are on hand to help.",
        "Our sales team will get in touch with you",
        "Hitachi Energy pioneered the HVDC technology and is the undisputed world leader in the HVDC field. We supply different solutions of all bushing types used in HVDC applications up to 1100 kV DC. The bushings are designed to meet individual customer requirements, such as replacing old bushings.",
