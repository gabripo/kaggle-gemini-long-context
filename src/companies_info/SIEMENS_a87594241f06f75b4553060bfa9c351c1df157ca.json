        "As the pace of the energy transition accelerates, upgrading or optimizing existing gas-fired power plants has emerged as a more viable option than constructing new ones. Thanks to technological advancements and improvements in energy efficiency, retrofitting older facilities presents a cost-effective means of enhancing output while simultaneously mitigating emissions.",
        "With Siemens Energy's Brownfield Engine Exchange concept, old gas turbines can be seamlessly replaced with new ones within a short outage period.       ",
        "The Brownfield Engine Exchange (BEX) solution is designed based on a plug-and-play concept, providing a streamlined retrofitting process that yields improved performance and efficiency for your gas turbine. By integrating our latest H2-capable gas turbines into your asset, BEX can also help future-proof your operation. BEX operates on three guiding principles:",
        "The BEX concept can be successfully implemented on Siemens Energy gas turbines, but also on a wide variety of other manufacturers' gas turbines, too:",
        "GE: Fr3, Fr5, Fr6, LM1600, LM2500, LM5000, LM6000 Baker Hughes: Fr5, Fr6 Hitachi: H25, PGT25 Solar: MARS, TAURUS Sulzer: S7 Mitsubishi: MF1-11 MAN Turbo: THM1203, 1304 Westinghouse: W251 Nuovo Pignone/GE: PGT10 & 16 Rolls-Royce: RB211",
        "Siemens Energy carried out a major outage for BASF in Germany. Thanks to our Brownfield Engine Exchange solution, the power plant could be modernized without interrupting ongoing operations. ",
        "If you have a power plant, you might benefit from BEX. Talk to one of our experts.",
