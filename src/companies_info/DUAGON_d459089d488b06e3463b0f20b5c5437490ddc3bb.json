        "Rugged and Maintenance-Free",
        " The BC50R is a maintenance-free box computer that has been designed, e.g., for data acquisition applications in rugged environments in vehicles, e.g. in trains, commercial vehicles, mobile machines or ships.",
        " All interfaces are implemented on rugged M12 connectors (USB, digital input and output, Gigabit Ethernet, CAN and legacy serial I/O). The housing is compliant to the IP65 protection class.",
        "Ready for Wireless Functions",
        " On the inside, the system offers two PCI Express Mini card slots with two SIM card slots for WLAN or 3G/4G functionality.  The necessary antenna connectors can be made available at the front panel. A GNSS interface is already provided at an antenna at the front.",
        "Solid Performance, Solid Housing",
        " The BC50R is powered by an AMD Embedded G-Series APU (Accelerated Processing Unit), the T48N, running at 1.4 GHz. The use of the Embedded G-Series makes for high scalability in CPU (single/dual core) performance.",
        " It is equipped with 2 GB of DDR3 SDRAM and offers SD card and mSATA slots. The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 to +70°C (+85°C for up to 10 minutes), its special aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heat sink for the internal electronics and in this way provides conduction cooling.",
        "Designed for In-Vehicle Operation",
        " The BC50R supports a 24 VDC and 36 VDC nom. class S2 power supply in compliance with EN 50155 or power supplies which comply with ISO 7637-2 (E-mark for automotive) (nominal input voltage 24 V) or with EN 60945 (ship). The power can be switched on and off using an ignition signal on the power connector, and a shutdown-delay time after switching off the ignition signal can be adjusted by software.",
        "Flexible and Scalable",
        " The combination of the various CPU/GPU options with the available selection of external interfaces (realized via separate graphics and I/O interface boards within the system) makes for an extremely flexible system design that can quickly be tailored to a vast number of applications.",
