        "Maximizing your ROI on grid automation equipment is simple: Let Hitachi Energy help you upgrade to next-generation hardware and software to extend the life of your current substation automation products and systems.",
        "Managing the life cycle of an installed base is one of the biggest challenges facing utilities today. An upgraded system uses improved technology for less risk and better sustainability and provides you with the following benefits:",
        "Complete substation automation life cycle support\nLeverage our expertise to ensure you get the most from your Hitachi Energy products and systems. Hitachi Energy’s upgrade and retrofit strategy covers the whole range of substation automation systems (SAS), from the communication level through the local SAS to the control and protection intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Specifically, we cover the following aspects:",
        "Our experts at your service\nAt Hitachi Energy, we have staff who do these projects every week. Our team can start with a comprehensive assessment of your existing assets and software. We’ll map out a plan to help you know what can be done and what it can deliver. When it is time for upgrades or other work, the Hitachi Energy team will help with technology selection, engineering, and installation. We’ll also help you with testing and commissioning.",
        "We understand the challenge of keeping the grid up and running.\nOur upgrades and retrofits are designed to help you meet the changing conditions of the grid. Among the areas of support we deliver, you’ll find upgrades for increased visibility and asset monitoring capabilities so you can implement proactive maintenance to extend asset lifespans. Also, when commissioning an upgrade or retrofit project, outages are a primary concern for utilities. Waiting until the end to replace a complete SAS system will increase downtime. Instead, a more gradual approach of incrementally upgrading components as required by their life cycles allows the downtime to be diluted over time. This enables you to avoid a significant outage period, and you can better plan necessary outages into your annual revision schedule. ",
        "Security, standards, and sustainability\nWe also deliver all our services in compliance with appropriate standards and regulations. Our team’s support will help you with cybersecurity, reliability, and regulatory compliance. When it’s time to retire an asset, we offer end-of-life services that help you do so cost-effectively and responsibly. We provide services that lower environmental impact through decommissioning, resale, disposal, replacement, and recycling.",
        "Get in touch with our team to determine which services would best address your challenges.",
        "We talk about patching when the activities are related to updating a firmware, operating system or software without adding any engineering value.",
        "What differentiates upgrade from retrofit? Both are an enhancement or replacement of something that already exists. They can be either software or hardware. An upgrade focuses on a single product and a retrofit on a system of products.",
        "Can I still get the right support from the vendor?",
        "Can we still patch the system to meet the latest cybersecurity requirements?\n",
        "Do I have a backup and recovery process and solution in place?\n",
        "Do we have spare parts? Where are they? Are those ready to use?\n",
        "Do we have all the tools we need to change and maintain the assets?\n",
        "Do we have the internal knowledge to maintain the assets safely?\n",
        "Do our assets comply with the latest regulatory guidelines for cybersecurity and asset management?\n",
        "If we compare a greenfield project with an upgrade&retrofit project, the key to making it work is the collaboration between the supplier and the customer. Therefore, you can contact us for any queries and support and we will work out a solution that suits your needs and requirements. For the contact, please see the Contact Us form here where you can always reach out for more help. ",
        "When we look at the lifecycle of substation automation, we go from a few weeks for cybersecurity updates to 40 years for panels or cables. From a sustainability point of view, it makes sense to replace components only when they reach the end of their life. ",
        "By replacing only the IED, not only is the environmental impact reduced, but the work required is also less. ",
        "Upgrades can be of different nature, the main driver for an upgrade is the lifecycle of the product, and this can be different if we talk about software or hardware. Therefore, our solutions are covering hardware and software upgrades depending on the respective lifecycle status. ",
        "The challenge is not the device itself but also the surrounding ecosystem, the more time that passes, the more maintenance costs increase because:",
        "Spare parts will have longer lead times with increasing costs.\n",
        "Low technical maintenance knowledge with the station operators and suppliers on older generation equipment.\n",
        "15-year-old tools may not be compatible with the operating system on a current laptop. Does the laptop still have the serial port required to connect the IED?\n",
        "Hitachi Energy's latest Relion REG670 Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) takes generator protection to a new performance level, ensuring unrivaled selectivity and sensitivity. Thanks to our extensive domain expertise, our lifecycle management services also ensure the upgrade of existing equipment to the latest technology is a simple and efficient process.",
        "With more than 100 years of engineering knowledge, our grid automation products will empower your business for many years to come. The state-of-the-art IED's have inherited their philosophy and algorithms from previous generations of proven Hitachi Energy technology. Ensuring you can be completely confident in the performance of your power plant for many years to come.\n",
        "With a strong track record of supplying generator and transformer protection, Hitachi Energy is committed to protecting your investment.\n",
        "Since 1964, more than 13,000 generator protection systems have been delivered globally. A total of 8,000 REG670 numerical protection system units have been supplied so far. Its renowned flexibility and adaptability to accommodate customer needs are unique and make it the world's most advanced generator protection solution.\n",
        "A site visit and assessment of the existing system is a valuable aspect to follow up when you request our support. ",
        "Depending on the product type and lifecycle status, the repairs can be of different nature. Therefore, we recommend contacting your country Hitachi Energy team, to see on the best possible solution.",
