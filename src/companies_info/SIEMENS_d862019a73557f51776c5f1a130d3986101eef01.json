        "Be it rapid prototyping or manufacturing parts for aero-derivative, gas and steam turbines or compressors, they can be designed faster, with increased flexibility, better materials, and optimized efficiency. This way, 3D printing enables cutting edge technologies with reduced time-to-market and quick upgrading of existing assets. Being both a pioneer and a leader in the industrialization of AM, Siemens Energy is in an excellent position to give its customers the products and tools they need for the next generation of power products.",
        "In the BMBF joint project \"IDEA\", partners from industry and research developed and built two production lines for the automated,  additive manufacturing of gas turbines and metal components. Siemens Energy and AT Toolcraft AG produced components using 3D-printing to demonste how not only large corporations, but also SMEs can economically utilize additive manufacturing for individualized components in medium batch sizes. Fraunhofer ILT's Laser Power Bed Fusion process and digital engineering along the entire product development chain play an important role in optimizing the components.",
        "Additive manufacturing (AM) has taken on a major role in the development and production of components and spare parts for Siemens Energy in recent years. In addition to setting up its own AM production lines and acquiring AM service provider Materials Solutions in 2016, the company is now expanding its commitment in this area with its investment in the start-up MakerVerse.",

        "Selective laser melting (SLM), also known as direct metal laser melting (DMLM) or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is a rapid prototyping, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM) technique designed to use a high power-density laser to melt and fuse metallic powders together. SLM is often considered a subcategory of selective laser sintering (SLS). The SLM process has the ability to fully melt the metal material into a solid three-dimensional part unlike SLS.",
        "Laser cladding is a form of surface coating that incorporates the use of lasers and a feeding mechanism to coat the substrate with a layer of desired metal or ceramic material. The laser melts the metal and coats the moving substrate with a fine layer. The feed metal is fully melted while the laser also transfers some of its energy to the substrate. This allows for the creation of a strong metallurgical bond between the substrate and the coating.",
