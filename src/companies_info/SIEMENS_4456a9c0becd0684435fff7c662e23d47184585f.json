        "Siemens Energy offers a comprehensive range of steam turbine products in the power output range from 90 to 1,900 MW. These are used in steam power plants as well as in nuclear and combined cycle power plants. With more than 8,000 steam turbines in service worldwide we provide proven technology, adapted to the specific local conditions.",
        "The compact arrangement features a two-cylinder design with an axial exhaust for use in combined cycle power plants. ",
        "The SST-3000 series covers the power output range from 90 to 275 MW. It features a separate high-pressure (HP) turbine and combined intermediate-pressure / low-pressure (IP / LP) turbine with single flow axial exhaust for 50 and 60 Hz applications.",
        "The SST-4000 series is our specialized turbine for non-reheat, combined cycle applications. With the specialized design of the blade path, the entire power range from 100 to 500 MW can be covered with the highest reliability and availability. More than 40 turbines of this type are already in operation or in the commissioning stage, with a total installed capacity of approximately 8,200 MW.",
        "The SST-4000 series consists of an intermediate-pressure and a low-pressure turbine. The installation is either high or low level arrangement with down, double-side or single-side exhaust. The turbine is able to provide process steam e. g. for industries or sea water desalination and can provide industrial heating.",
        "Thanks to its systematically modular design, the SST-4000 series can easily be adapted to the individual operating conditions and thermal cycle design of the plant. Its fast installation, thanks to prefabricated, tested modules delivered ready for connection, is of additional advantage.",
        "Siemens Energy Steam Turbines of the SST-5000 series are operated in combined cycle power plants (CCPP) and in steam power plants (SPP). ",
        "The SST-5000 steam turbine combined with a gas turbine, is able to achieve a net plant efficiency of more than 64 percent in combined cycle applications.",
        "Siemens Energy Steam Turbines of the SST-6000 series are widely operated in steam power plants with a power output up to 1,200 MW and an efficiency up to more than 46 percent.",
        "Products of the SST-6000 series consist of a high-pressure turbine, an intermediate-pressure (IP) turbine, and up to three low-pressure turbines for 50 and 60 Hz.",
        "The SST-6000 is installed as a high-level arrangement with down exhaust. Various extractions (up to 10 stages) are possible for feed water preheating, process steam, and district heating. The installed capacity of SST-6000 all over the world is more than 100,000 MW.",
        "Siemens Energy Steam Turbines of the SST-9000 series are highly reliable for the application in conventional islands of advanced pressurized water reactors in nuclear power plants, with a power output up to 1,900 MW.",
        "The half-speed (25 turns per second) SST-9000 series consists of a double-flow high-pressure saturated steam turbine (HD) and up to three twin-flow low-pressure turbines (ND) with shrunk-on wheel disc rotors. Siemens low-pressure turbines with shrunk-on wheel discs represent technology that has been proven over decades. The result: no stress corrosion cracking and thus no replacement of the low-pressure rotor or wheel discs during the excepted service life.",
        "More than 20,000 steam turbines were delivered to sites all over the world within the past 100 years. Find below some chosen examples",
