        "The BL50W is a fanless, maintenance-free box computer that has been designed for independent use or as display computer electronics for embedded wireless applications in transportation, e.g. in trains, commercial vehicles, mobile machines or airplanes.",
        " Four PCI Express Mini Card slots each with dual SIM make it possible to flexibly implement the whole range of wireless interfaces such as mobile service standards GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), LTE (4G) and derivates and wireless communication standards WLAN / Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 and derivates. A GNSS interface supporting positioning systems GPS and GLONASS complements the possibilities.",
        " The rugged BL50W is powered by a dual-core AMD Embedded G-Series APU (Accelerated Processing Unit), the T48N, running at 1.4 GHz. The G-Series combines low-power CPUs and advanced GPUs, in this case an AMD Radeon HD 6310, into a single embedded device. The use of the Embedded G-Series makes for high scalability in CPU (single/dual core) and graphics performance (various Radeon GPUs or none at all).",
        " The BL50W is equipped with 2 GB of DDR3 SDRAM and offers SD card and mSATA slots. A SATA hard-disk/solid-state drive can be installed within the housing as an option. The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 °C to +70 °C (+85 °C for up to 10 minutes), its special aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heatsink for the internal electronics and in this way provides conduction cooling.",
        " The BL50W supports up to two DisplayPort interfaces with full HDresolution. In addition, a multitude of other I/O is available at the front panel, including two Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0, variable slots for legacy serial I/O (e.g. RS232) or CAN bus, general purpose inputs and relay outputs.",
        " The BL50W comes with its own integrated 30W 24 VDC nom. class S2 wide-range power supply and is in compliance with EN 50155 and ISO 7637-2 (E-mark for automotive). The power can be switched on and off using an ignition signal on the power connector, and a run-down time after switching off the ignition signal can be adjusted by software.",
        " The combination of the various CPU/GPU options with the available selection of external interfaces (realized via separate graphics and I/O interface boards within the system) makesfor an extremely flexible system design that can quickly be tailored to a vast number of applications.",
