        "For IoT or Storage-Intensive Applications",
        " The BL51E is a fanless, maintenance-free box computer for embedded applications in transportation, e.g., in trains, buses or commercial vehicles. Its HDD/SSD shuttle provides the storage capacity necessary for entertainment servers or video surveillance systems. A vast number of I/O functions and options seamlessly link the BL51E to the IoT, making vehicles smart.",
        "A Multi-Talent for Wireless Communication",
        " The BL51E can take over typical on-board wireless functions, whether it is an Internet connection for passengers or locating the vehicle. A GNSS positioning interface is available. Four PCI Express Mini Card slots each with two micro-SIM slots and dual SIM support provide maximum flexibility in implementing mobile service standards up to 4G LTE or WLAN/WLAN IEEE 802.11, and derivates.",
        "Solid Processing Performance",
        " The BL51E is powered by an Intel Atom E3950 running at 1.6 GHz. Other dual/quad core processors of the Intel Atom E3900 series can be used, giving high scalability in CPU performance. The box PC features up to 8 GB DDR3 SDRAM and offers an SD card and a SATA HDD/SSD shuttle both accessible at the rear, plus in-system eMMC memory.",
        "Fanless Operation for Mobile Applications",
        " The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 °C to +70 °C (+85 °C for up to 10 minutes). Its rugged aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heat sink for the internal electronics and provides conduction cooling.",
        "A Multitude of I/O",
        " The BL51E supports two DisplayPort interfaces with maximum 4K resolution, four Gigabit Ethernet, two with PoE+ capability, two USB 2.0, legacy serial I/O (RS232) and CAN bus, general purpose inputs and relay outputs.",
        "Railway-Compliant PSU with Ignition Function",
        " The BL51E has a class S2 wide range power supply in compliance with EN 50155 and prepared for ISO 7637-2 (E-mark for automotive). Standard versions support 30 W with 24 V DC nom. (10 V to 50.4 V), 110 V DC nom. is available as an option. In the 24 V DC version, power can be switched on and off using an ignition signal on the power connector, and a run-down time after switching off the ignition signal can be adjusted by software.",
        "Long-Term Available and Future-Safe",
        " Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
