        "Hitachi Energy's cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. Hitachi Energy offers a complete pure cooling system portfolio for industrial and power transmission applications with cooling capacity from 2 kW to several megawatts.",
        "Hitachi Energy's pure water cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. The cooling media in our solutions is water. The specific application determines when to use tap water, glycol water, or pure water.",
        "Our cooling system solutions are available for every stage of the product life cycle from development, design, sales and production, to assembly, testing, installation, commissioning, training and service.",
        "Our cooling media is water. The quality of water needed is determined by the specific application: ",
        "Pure water - when water with low conductivity is needed",
        "Power electronic applications such as:",
        "Tap water - when conductivity is no issue",
        "Applications include",
        "Glycol/water mixture - when there is a risk for freezing",
        "The principle of all pure-water cooling systems is fundamentally the same. There is a main loop cooling the object. Water transfers the heat to water-to-water or water-to-air heat exchangers. From the main loop a small part of the flow passes a water-processing circuit. The water is filtered mechanically. If necessary, it is also continuously purified from ions and oxygen. The conductivity of the cooling water can be maintained as low as <0.1µS/cm (at 25°C).",
        "Our cooling systems are prefabricated and assembled in one or several units. Most of the systems include control equipment with PLC and software. The systems are tested and verified before delivery.",
        "As we deliver systems globally, we have developed design standards and control routines for efficient onsite installation and start up. Most of our customers can easily set up the systems themselves by following our manuals. ",
        "As an option the systems can be delivered as a ready-to use container solution. This can be used to optimize logistics, minimize outage time and installation time. ",
        "In a regular container solution the cooling system pump unit, treatment circuit, motor starters as well as the protection and system control are mounted into an enclosure or container. Optional equipment for the container may include insulation, ventilation, lighting, heating and air conditioning. \n",
