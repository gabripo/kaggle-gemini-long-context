        "With our Blue portfolio of innovative switchgear technology, you can reduce your global warming impact to zero. That means zero F-gases, zero greenhouse gas emissions and zero harm to the environment. ",
        "The technology of our products sets international trends. We continuously ensure our high quality through optimized production processes, constant product development and a certified quality management system.",
        "Vacuum interrupters form the backbone of our 3AV1 Blue portfolio. Based on more than 40 years of experience in medium-voltage range and more than 6 million delivered vacuum interrupters, Siemens Energy has introduced this proven technology to high-voltage power networks in 2010. This game-changing technology offers several advantages:",
        "Our complete 3AP family up to 1100 kV relies on our arc-quenching principles, either the self-compression or the dynamic self-compression principle using the thermal energy of the arc. Siemens patented this method of arc quenching in 1973 and has continued to develop the technology of the self-compression interrupter unit ever since.",
        "The drive concept of the 3AP circuit breaker family is based on the patented stored-energy spring principle. The mechanism types differ in terms of the number, size and arrangement of the opening and closing springs. Both the opening and closing springs are located inside the operating mechanism, thereby achieving a simple and sturdy device.",
        "All Siemens Energy high-voltage circuit breakers are designed in a well proven modular platform concept. This leads to a wide variety of breaker types and strong flexibility with regard to various applications according to our customers’ requirements as well as high availability at eminently competitive price.  ",
        "The main components, such as the operating mechanism, control system, base frame, kinematic chain and insulator designs are identical and based on decades of manufacturing and operating experience – and are also used in our GIS switchgear range.",
        "You can find informational materials on our circuit breakers and details about our services here.",
        "We can gladly help you with installation, commissioning, diagnostics and malfunctions",

        "Dealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues.\r\nBy Frank Jossi",
