        "The power generation infrastructure is decentralized, consumers are becoming prosumers, and the aging grid system is unable to accommodate this new transition. In parallel, renewables are also steadily increasing, and with the emergence of IoT, cloud and low-cost battery energy storage systems, the power system has become highly complex today. While this trend is contributing to sustainable energy production, it also helps to provide energy independence for participating stakeholders such as commercial and industrial enterprises, independent power producers, and remote communities. The challenge remaining for all stakeholders is how to adapt to this new decentralized model.",
