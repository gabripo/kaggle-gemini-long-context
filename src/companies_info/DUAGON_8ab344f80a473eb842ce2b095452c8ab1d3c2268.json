        "The BC50I is a fanless, maintenance-free box computer that has been designed for independent use or as display computer electronics for use in industrial applications, e.g. for machine control, surveillance or commercial vehicles or robotics.",
        " It is powered by an AMD Embedded G-Series APU (Accelerated Processing Unit), the T48N, running at 1.4 GHz. The G-Series combines low-power CPUs and advanced GPUs, in this case an AMD Radeon HD 6310, into a single embedded device.",
        " The use of the EmbeddedG-Series makes for high scalability in CPU (single/dual core) and graphics performance (various Radeon GPUs or none at all).",
        " The BC50I is equipped with 2 GB of DDR3 SDRAM and offers SD card and mSATA slots. A SATA hard-disk/solid-state drive can be installed within the housing as an option.",
        " The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 to +70Â°C, its special aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heat sink for the internal electronics and in this way provides conduction cooling.",
        " The BC50I supports up to two DisplayPort interfaces with a maximum resolution of 2560x1600 each. The DisplayPort interfaces and all other I/O are available at the unit's front panel on standard connectors like USB, 9-pin D-Sub (optional serial I/O), RJ45 (Gigabit Ethernet) and DisplayPort.",
        " On the inside, the system offers one PCI Express Mini card slot with a SIM card slot. The necessary antenna connectors can be made available at the front panel.",
        " The BC50I comes with its own integrated 24 VDC nom. (16 to 36 V) power supply.",
        " The combination of the various CPU/GPU options with the available selection of external interfaces (realized via separate graphics and I/O interface boards within the system) makes for an extremely flexible system design that can quickly be tailored to a vast number of applications.",
