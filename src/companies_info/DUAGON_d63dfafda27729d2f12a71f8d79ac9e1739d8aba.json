        "The SA25 provides a GPS receiver interface which supports L1 frequency, C/A code and SPS. An external active or passive antenna can be connected to a rugged SMA connector at the front panel. The received GPS signals are sent to the host via a 5V TTL COM port with a data transfer rate of 4800 baud (configurable).",
        " SA-Adapters are small universal boards providing the line drivers for legacy serial I/O, fieldbus interfaces and other small I/O functions. One serial line is provided per adapter, which can be plugged directly to the CPU board as a mezzanine. Alternatively, the adapter can be connected to the front panel via ribbon cable. The SA concept allows to add additional I/O interfaces to many of duagon's CPU boards, enhancing flexibility with regard to the line transceivers and isolation requirements. Whether a specific SA-Adapter (or a mix of different SA-Adapters) fits on a specific CPU board is determined by a combination of mechanical, performance, FPGA and operating system criteria and needs to be verified for every board configuration requested.",
