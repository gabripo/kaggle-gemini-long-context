        "The BL70S is a fanless, maintenance-free box computer for embedded storage applications such as content servers or video recorders. It offers two external SATA shuttles with hot-plug support. The BL70S is powered by an Intel Core i7-3517UE CPU, running at 1.7 GHz. Other processors of the 3rd generation Intel Core i7 family can be used which makes for high scalability in CPU performance. The BL70S is equipped with 4 GB of DDR3 SDRAM and offers microSD card and mSATA slots.",
        "Extensive Ethernet Functionality",
        " On the front of the rugged BL70S five Gigabit Ethernet interfaces are accessible. Four of these ports share one Gigabit Ethernet port from the chipset via a switch, while one port is used exclusively as Gigabit Ethernet uplink. The four ports routed over the switch support Power-over-Ethernet.",
        "Wireless Communication",
        " One PCI Express Mini Card slot with two SIM card slots offers the possibility to implement the wide range of functionality available on this form factor. This includes for example GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), LTE (4G) and derivates,  WLAN / Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 and derivates as well as positioning systems GPS or GLONASS.",
        "Fanless Operation for Mobile Applications",
        " The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 °C to +70 °C (+85 °C for up to 10 minutes), its special aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heat sink for the internal electronics and in this way provides conduction cooling.",
        "Railway-Compliant PSU with Ignition Function",
        " The BL70S comes with its own integrated class S2 wide-range power supply with 24 V DC and 36 V DC nominal input voltage and a power consumption of 30 W and is in compliance with EN 50155 and ISO 7637-2 (E-mark for automotive). The power can be switched on and off using an ignition signal on the power connector, and a run-down time after switching off the ignition signal can be adjusted by software.",
        "Flexible System Design",
        " The various CPU options with the available selection of external interfaces makes for an extremely flexible system design that can quickly be tailored to a vast number of applications. The BL70S supports one DisplayPort interface with a resolution of 2560x1600. In addition, a multitude of other I/O is available at the front panel, including two USB 2.0 and variable slots for legacy serial I/O (e.g. RS232) or CAN bus.",
