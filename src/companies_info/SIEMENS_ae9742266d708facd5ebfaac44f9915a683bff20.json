        "Siemens Energy has developed a device in which the isolating distance has been integrated in the SF6 gas compartment in order to reduce external environmental influences. The DCB (Disconnecting Circuit Breaker) is used as a circuit breaker and also as a disconnector – two functions combined in one device. An additional air-insulated earthing switch can be mounted onto the supporting structure for voltages up to 145 kV.",
        "Main features:",
        "Advantages:",
        "Like all of our circuit breakers, the core components were taken from our other circuit breakers, disconnectors and GIS product family in line with our proven modular design. The Disconnecting Circuit Breakers are type-tested according to class M2 and C2 of IEC 62271-108, a specific standard for combined switching devices.",
        "The Disconnecting Circuit Breaker for 145 kV has a three-pole operating mechanism with a common base (FG), and a single-pole operating mechanism on separate bases (FI) for 420 kV.",
        "You can find details on our Dead Tank Compact circuit breakers and information about our services here.",
        "We can gladly help you with installation, commissioning, diagnostics and malfunctions",
