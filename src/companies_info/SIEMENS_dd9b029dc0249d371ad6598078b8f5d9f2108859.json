        "Compressors are essential to move, store or transform hydrogen. From the point at which hydrogen is produced to the point where it is consumed, our wide compression portfolio supports many applications across the hydrogen value chain. Applications for hydrogen compression include: ",
        "Your partner for hydrogen compression solutions",
        "We are a global market leader in hydrogen compression applications with over 2500+ units operating in hydrogen applications, representing over 2,500,000 installed horsepower and over 100 years of compression experience.  We can provide you with the optimum equipment solution, with a high lifetime value, for all your compression needs. ",
        "Our portfolio gives you more technology choices for the optimum solution for your project-specific requirements, considering: ",
        "Welcome to the next generation of large-scale H2 compression! We’re excited to introduce our latest development, the advanced hydrogen turbocompressor, designed to serve pure hydrogen, hydrogen-rich, and other low mole weight applications.",
        "Our hydrogen compressor meets all customer and international design standards. Each unit is meticulously built, designed, and tested to ensure it withstands the most stringent quality checks. The result? A product that provides high efficiency, reliability, compactness and above all, superior hydrogen compression in pipelines, efuels, and other green production processes.",
        "Embrace the power of efficiency and sustainability at any scale with our advanced hydrogen compressor - a testament to our decades of experience and unwavering commitment to support our customers through the energy transition.",
        "For further information contact one of our experts below.",
        "The compressor technology doesn’t “care” about the “colour” of the hydrogen and how it is produced, it simply compresses according to the physics of a low mol-weight gas application. Both reciprocating and turbo compressors cover the complete map of low mol-weight applications. With each product having its strengths in overlapping areas, the choice of the product requires both technical as well as economic considerations. ",
        "For this reason, finding a solution for hydrogen compression is always project-specific and can even combine both products to find the optimal and most efficient solution for the client’s compression needs. In general, our reciprocating compressors apply to applications which have small suction volume flows, high pressure ratios and/or high process flexibility requirements whilst our centrifugal compressors apply to low compression ratio and medium to high volume flow applications.",
        "Compression is the enabling technology for safe and cost-effective transport, storage and use of hydrogen throughout the value chain. This white paper explores the challenges of H₂ compression and outlines its applications.",
        "Download our interactive hydrogen landscape pdf to discover our range of products and services.",
        "To help ensure you develop accurate and optimized solutions, there are key considerations which need to be clearly defined when developing your hydrogen compression solution:",
        "To understand why these are important, watch our green hydrogen compressor story here.",
        "With over 100 years compression experience, serving a vast compression fleet worldwide, we are globally recognised as a leader in hydrogen compression. Discuss your hydrogen compression needs with our hydrogen experts.",
