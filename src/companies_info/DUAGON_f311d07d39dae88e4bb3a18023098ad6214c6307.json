        "Robust Panel PC for Interactive Rail Applications",
        " The DC19 panel PC is a rugged, fanless and maintenance-free human-machine interface (HMI) for railway applications. It features a 10.4\" display and touch screen. Its small, ultra-flat mechanical design and configuration options save space in the driver cabin and allow the panel to be tailored for all types of applications in different train models. In addition, its full software compatibility with the 12.1\" DC20 panel PC both increases flexibility and lowers costs, e.g., if an upgrade to a larger panel is necessary.",
        "High-Quality, High-Resolution Display",
        " The DC19 houses a robust impact-resistant XGA TFT LCD display with LED backlight. It also features LEDs and a light sensor at the front. Due to its high resolution and optimized usability, it is a perfect choice for, e.g., CCTV.",
        "Powerful & Energy-Efficient Computing",
        " The DC19 is powered by an Intel Atom processor from the E3900 series running at up to 1.6 GHz and equipped with up to 8 GB RAM with ECC and a 32 GB soldered eMMC. Standard interfaces include two Gigabit Ethernet, one CAN, one audio, digital I/O and RS232/RS422/RS485 - all available on M12 connectors at the back of the panel PC.",
        " Two PCI Express Mini Card interfaces can control wireless communication functions like 4G LTE and GNSS. Two micro-SIM card slots with dual-SIM functionality are accessible at the back of the panel.",
        "Flexible Rail Network Connection Options",
        " The DC19 can provide Multifunction Vehicle Bus (MVB) master or slave support where necessary, by adding an MVB PCI Express Mini Card. This makes the display scalable for different applications.",
        "Extremely Rugged, Perfectly Rail-Ready",
        " The DC19 comes with an extremely rugged housing with an IP65 compliant front. It supports a railway-compliant power supply of 24 V DC to 110 V DC, its internal PSU complying with EN 50155 class S2. Also in compliance with the standard, the DC19 operates in a -25 °C to +70 °C environment (+85 °C for 10 minutes), achieved through fanless conduction-cooling technology.",
        " All electronic components are soldered to withstand shock and vibration, backed up by solid M12 connectors, and protected by conformal coating. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety. The panel PC meets all important requirements for railway equipment for fast, competitive time-to-market even in mission-critical environments.",
