        "Extension for Various Applications",
        " The ME6 is a modular extension for embedded applications in transportation, e.g., in trains or wayside. The module adds wireless connectivity and fieldbus and audio functionality to the system CPU. Main applications of the module include predictive maintenance, IoT gateway, diagnostics server, smart vehicle, passenger information and ticketing systems.",
        "Wireless Connectivity",
        " The ME6 comes with one PCI Express Mini Card slot for LTE modems supported by two front-accessible micro-SIM card slots. A second PCI Express Mini Card slot can be used for a WLAN modem.",
        "Fieldbus and Audio Functionality",
        " The ME6 is equipped with one PCI Express Mini Card slot which is prepared for adding an MVB, CAN bus or audio module. The functions can be made available on up to two D-Sub connectors at the front panel.",
        "Modular System for Easy Configuration",
        " Due to duagon's modular concept, the ME6 offers flexibility in built-to-order configurations. Via its extension connectors, the box can be easily combined with pre-fabricated CPU modules or other extension modules, for example a PSU or removable storage shuttles, providing additional features and short delivery times.",
        " In the modular system, the data transfer between the modules as well as the power distribution between the individual components takes place via the extension connectors standardized by duagon.",
        "Flexible System Installation",
        " Various mounting options facilitate the integration of the box into an existing environment. The standard 35 mm DIN Rail mounting offers space saving mounting of all system modules on a single rail. Wall mounting and mounting in a 19\" rack using adaption brackets are an option.",
        " The aluminum housing with cooling fins allows fanless operation. The ME6 has no moving parts, making it maintenance free.",
        "Rolling Stock Qualified and Long-Term Availability",
        " The wireless and fieldbus module is qualified for rolling stock and wayside applications. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
