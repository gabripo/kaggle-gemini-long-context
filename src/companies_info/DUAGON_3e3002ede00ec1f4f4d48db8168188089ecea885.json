        "Safe Remote I/O for Train Control Systems",
        " KT8 is a safe, remote I/O box inside the duagon SAFE CONTROL (d-SC) System.The modular system platform d-SC is usable for safety-critical train applications like train control, automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train protection (ATP) up to SIL 4 (EN5012x) or SIL 3 (IEC61508).",
        " The KT8 system consists of the head unit K100 and d-SC I/O board slots. The I/O boards are completely configurable and all system components are directly linked via Ethernet over the backplane. The head unit K100 provides the EtherCAT connections to other d-SC system boxes, the power input for the system and two hex switches. With the hex switches of the K100 the unique chassis ID within an EtherCAT network is defined.",
        "Modular I/O Configuration",
        " Based on modular 19\" technology, KT8 provides eight slots for safe I/O cards, which can be configured as built-to-order (BTO) options. d-SC I/O cards support the common I/O requirements requested in trains. The KT series of systems provides scalable sizes of eight slots, six slots and four slots.",
        "Part of the duagon SAFE CONTROL System",
        " d-SC is a modular SIL 4 certifiable family of CompactPCI-based standard products usable for every kind of safety-critical railway application - from a single function to the main control system of the train. It can be configured to control anything in the train that requires functional safety - under SIL 4, SIL 3 or SIL 2 requirements. d-SC communicates via standard EtherCAT real-time Ethernet and interfaces to any type of consist fieldbus network like MVB, CANopen, Profinet etc. This makes it easy to integrate into a TCN network as well as into regionally different Train Control Systems like ETCS, CTCS, ATCS or Klub-U. The high level of flexibility of d-SC results in significant cost and time savings during computerization of the train.",
        "Compact and Cost-Saving Remote I/O",
        " Being modular and SIL 4 certifiable, the KT series reduces the certification risk and efforts. This makes both your system costs and project schedule predictable. All KT systems have a dedicated EtherCAT component, the I/O head, for interconnection of the boxes and power supply. This in turn reduces cabling. I/O functions can still be located close to the remote actors and sensors, with fast data transmission within the d-SC system. The compact format with a maximum width of 40 HP and a reduced depth compared to standard 3U systems allows installation even where space is very restricted, simplifying retrofitting of older trains.",
        "Certification and Standards Compliance Included",
        " Safety-related d-SC components come with certification packages and complete support for the safe operating system QNX, including safe protocols, I/O framework etc. All d-SC components that are safety-relevant are developed according to EN 50128 and EN 50129 standards and comply with all environmental requirements of EN 50155 for rolling stock: temperature, shock, vibration, humidity, dust, isolation, PSU hold-up times, EMC regulations etc.",
        "Mounting and Cooling Options",
        " The system can be wall or rack-mounted, also on a DIN rail, and is air cooled.",
