        "Truly Rugged COM Express Module",
        " The CM50 is an ultra-rugged COM Express module with Type 10 Pin-Out for rolling stock, public transportation and industry applications. It is operable in an extended temperature range of -40 °C up to +85 °C (Tcase). The use of soldered components makes the board resistant to shock and vibration.",
        "Versions for Extremely Harsh Environments",
        " For applications that need reliable operation even under the harshest environmental conditions, a specially hardened version is available - the CM50C. CM50C modules are embedded in a closed aluminum frame that ensures optimum EMC protection, efficient conduction cooling and extended resistance to vibration and shock. Direct air cooling is possible by placing a heat sink on the cover. The innovative mechanical design around the COM.0 electronics makes it an ultra-rugged module.",
        "Scalable Low Power Processor",
        " The Intel E3900 CPU series provides a scalable performance up to 4 cores and integrated quality graphics. Intel VT-x virtualization support allows to run multiple applications on a single hardware platform, saving costs. Due to the low power dissipation (depending on the CPU), no active cooling is necessary and very small designs are feasible.",
        "Safety, Security and Connectivity",
        " The board management controller has supervision functions (onboard voltages, temperature etc.) that make the board suitable for safety-related applications. The Trusted Platform Module supports features like secure/measured booting and fast cryptographic execution. The CM50 comes with a large variety of interfaces, including, e.g., Digital Display Interfaces, HD Audio, PCI Express and Gigabit Ethernet. This enables implementing many functions on a very small form factor.",
        "Long-Term Available",
        " Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
