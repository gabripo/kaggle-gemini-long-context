        "Our new generation of tap-changers uses the latest vacuum interrupter technology. This design philosophy allows the arcs during load commutations to occur in vacuum interrupters and not in the tap-changer oil. This greatly reduces the need for maintenance and creates the potential for using environmentally friendly insulating fluids.\n\r\nHitachi Energy offers a full range of products for both high-voltage and low-voltage regulation. Our tap-changers are paired with robust, dependable motor drives that are configurable to meet a wide range of environmental conditions and customer specifications.",
