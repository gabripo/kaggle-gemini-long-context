        "Step voltage regulators can improve the utility's return on investment by increasing demand at off-peak periods and, with certain accessories, even reduce the peak demand load. This translates into improved revenue for the utility company while also improving the quality of service to the customer.",
        "The energy market is rapidly evolving with the energy transition as one of the most fundamental changes: What challenges does this rapidly changing energy landscape pose for customers?",
        "Our voltage regulators are a cost-saving alternative to grid-expansion, as they can be easily installed and integrated into existing grid structures. We offer flexible regulation models for optimum operation.",
        "The standard voltage regulator provides approximately 10% adjustment. However, in some designs, regulations of 15% and 20% are also available. Available at 50 or 60 Hz, their ratings are calculated according to the voltage level of the transformer they are connected to (i.e., 10%). Voltage level ratings for 1-phase voltage regulators vary between 2.5kV and 19.9 kV and between  76.2kVA and 1110kVA. 3-phase units are available at 13.2kV, 34.5kV, or from 500kVA up to 4,000kVA.",
        "Siemens Energy invented the voltage regulator in 1932. Voltage regulators are highly reliable soutions for stabilizing voltage fluctions in the customer's grid 24/7. They are notably more cost-effective for customers compared to other oprions. Voltage regulators come in 1-phase or 3-phase models. Different cooling systems are available. They can be applied to any electrical system to improve voltage quality. The standard voltage regulator provides approximately 10% adjustment. However, in some designs, regulations of 15% and 20% are also available. Available at 50 or 60 Hz, their ratings are calculated according to the voltage level of the transformer they are connected to (i.e., 10%). Voltage level ratings for 1-phase voltage regulators vary between 2.5 kV and 19.9 kV and between 31.8 kVA and 889 kVA. 3-phase units are available at 13.2 kV, 34.5 kV, or from 500 kVA up to 4,000 kVA.",
        "JFR and SFR medium-voltage voltage regulators",
        "When it comes to voltage regulation, Siemens Energy provides technology that serves the customer. Our manufacturing experience for voltage regulators and controls is unsurpassed in the industry. Today, Siemens Energy has the largest quantity of regulators installed worldwide. The type JFR has been an industry leader since 1936. It is a single-phase 5/8% step regulator utilizing the Siemens Energy type MJ4 or MJ6 control panel or adaptable to any control panel.",

        "The Siemens Energy padmount voltage regulator offers a new dimension to underground system planning and design that preserves an aesthetically pleasing environment. Maintaining all of the functionality of a traditional regulator, the padmount voltage regulator promotes safety because there are no exposed high-voltage lines. Additionally, the tamper-resistant, secured cabinet design protects the access to components including the drain valve, bushings and cover bolts. The layout and positioning of the controls is on the narrow end of the box, which allows for additional placement options and smaller operational space requirements. The controls are ergonomically positioned for easy access for operators. The bushing connections and sample valve reside in the lower enclosure. With the Siemens Energy padmount voltage regulator, safety and reliability are enhanced, construction costs are reduced, and land requirements are smaller for a more attractive physical profile for the public.",
        "The type SFR is a vertically integrated, three-phase regulator, which also comes with the capability of separating the tap changer. This significantly increases the life of the regulator. Siemens Energy offers distinct advantages with all of our three-phase regulators engineered and manufactured in-house. Our expertise in both technology and service gives us additional advantages in the custom engineering necessary for most three-phase regulator applications. The SFR voltage regulator has proven its reliability and durability in the toughest environments. Unit construction, tough exterior coating and a side inspection door are just a few of the time-tested features of today’s SFR. Additionally, Siemens Energy offers the popular SFR-X which features a separate tap-changing mechanism compartment allowing for easy inspection and maintenance. Separating the regulator tap-changer significantly increases the life of the regulator by eliminating arcing in the main tank containing the coil and core.",
