        "As power generation sources become increasingly distributed, intermittent and volatile, achieving the levels of control and performance needed requires a more intelligent, efficient and reliable grid. This is now possible thanks to significant advances in grid automation technology in recent years, including the development of digital substations. ",
        "The world’s use of energy for transportation, buildings, and the industry is shifting quickly to carbon-free electric power generation. With a rapid expansion of distributed generation technology and new customer loads to be served, the electric grid needs to keep pace. ",
