        "EconiQ GIS ELK-3, 420 kV is a landmark achievement that entirely substitutes sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in 420 kV switchgear with an eco-efficient gas mixture. It showcases Hitachi Energy’s commitment to eliminate SF6 in transmission GIS voltage ratings.",
        "EconiQ GIS ELK-3, 420 kV is the ideal solution for reliable eco-efficient energy supply up to a rated voltage of 420 kV. Based on a few building blocks with standardized dimensions, it supports all typical substation layouts,while offering the same footprint as traditional SF6 GIS. Thanks to its easy operation, it allows for maximum reliability.",
        "The EconiQ GIS ELK-3, 420 kV operates with an insulation gas mixture of Fluoronitriles (C4-FN), Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Oxygen (O2). This mixture essentially eliminates the CO2 equivalent emissions of the insulation medium compared to SF6.",
        "EconiQ is Hitachi Energy’s eco-efficient portfolio for sustainability where products, services and solutions are proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance.",
