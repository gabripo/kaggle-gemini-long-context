        "Extension for Various Applications",
        " The ME2 is a modular extension for embedded applications in transportation, e.g., in trains or wayside. The module adds storage capacity to the system CPU. Main applications of the module include CCTV, predictive maintenance, IoT gateway, diagnostics server, smart vehicle, passenger information and ticketing systems.",
        "Storage Capacity",
        " The ME2 comes with a shuttle suitable for a 2.5 SATA HDD/SSD disk with a height of either 7 mm or 9.5 mm. For higher security requirements a lockable SATA shuttle is optionally available. For higher storage capacity two ME2 modules can be combined providing up to 8 TB.",
        "Modular System for Easy Configuration",
        " Due to duagon's modular concept, the ME2 offers flexibility in built-to-order configurations. Via its extension connectors, the box can be easily combined with pre-fabricated CPU modules or other extension modules, for example a PSU or a wireless communication module, providing additional features and short delivery times.",
        " In the modular system, the data transfer between the modules as well as the power distribution between the individual components takes place via the extension connectors standardized by duagon.",
        "Flexible System Installation",
        " Various mounting options facilitate the integration of the box into an existing environment. The standard 35 mm DIN rail mounting offers space saving mounting of all system modules on a single rail. Wall mounting and mounting in a 19 rack using adaption brackets are an option.",
        " The aluminum housing with cooling fins allows fanless operation. ME2 has no moving parts, making it maintenance free.",
        "Rolling Stock Qualified and Long-Term Availability",
        " The data storage module is qualified for rolling stock and wayside applications. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
