        "The CB70C is a member of a new family of Rugged COM Express modules which is controlled by a third generation Intel Core i7 processor running at up to 3.1 GHz maximum turbo frequency bringing state-of-the-art PC technology onto a small form factor. This means a scalable performance with 1 up to 4 cores, integrated graphics, as well as support of Intel AMT or Open CL 1.1.",
        " The board can be controlled using a Board Management Controller and an adaptable BIOS which ensures flexibility in tailoring the complete system for the final application. Intel AMT support is actively integrated in the BIOS adaptation.",
        " The modules are 100% compatible to COM Express modules of Pin-out Type 6. They conform to the new VITA-59 standard which specifies the mechanics to make COM Express modules suitable for operation in harsh environments.",
        " The modules are embedded in a covered frame ensuring EMC protection and allowing efficient conductive cooling. Air cooling is also possible by applying a heat sink on top of the cover.",
        " The CB70C accommodates up to 16 GB of directly soldered main memory and supports other memory like USB Flash on the carrier board.",
        " The interfaces include a combination of PCI Express links, LVDS, DDI, VGA, high-definition audio, SATA, Ethernet and USB.",
        " The CB70C is screened for operation from -40°C to +85°C (Tcase). Only soldered components are used to withstand shock and vibration, and the design is optimized for conformal coating.",
        " For evaluation and development purposes a microATX carrier board, the XC15, is available.",
