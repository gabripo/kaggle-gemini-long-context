        "The EconiQ ELK-04, 145 kV is the most robust SF6-free gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). It combines a low carbon footprint, superior reliability, and low life cycle costs in a flexible product layout.",
        "It is a sustainable and eco-efficient switchgear that has proven capabilities to reduce the CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions during the complete life cycle of the product, compared to conventional SF6 and other SF6-free technologies.",
        "EconiQ ELK-04, 145 kV uses a gas-mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) and small amounts of fluoronitrile (C4-FN) that delivers significantly lower life cycle assessment (LCA) ratings over the lifetime of the equipment.",
        "The eco-efficient equipment is based on the solid legacy of ELK-04, 145 kV, which has the largest installed base of any sub-transmission GIS in the world. It uses the same proven gas-circuit breaker technology that has been utilized for decades in transmission systems.",
        "EconiQ is Hitachi Energy’s eco-efficient portfolio for sustainability where products, services and solutions are proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance.",
