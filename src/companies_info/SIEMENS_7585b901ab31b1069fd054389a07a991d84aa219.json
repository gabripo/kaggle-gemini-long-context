        "With maximized uptime, top-class performance, and a low environmental footprint, the SGT-750 offers you high lifetime profitability. It is a perfect choice for the oil and gas industry as well as for industrial power generation.",
        "The SGT-750 is a lightweight industrial gas turbine designed and developed to incorporate the size and weight advantages of the aeroderivative gas turbine while maintaining the robustness, flexibility and longevity of the traditional heavy-duty industrial gas turbine.",
        "A new standard for efficiency, emission and reliability, watch the video.",
        "The SGT-750 has the highest efficiency and power in its class combined with Dry Low Emissions (DLE). As a result, you can expect lowest lifecycle operating costs and the best possible return on investment. Even running on part load, the SGT-750 keeps the highest efficiency and at the same time an increased time between overhauls, with guaranteed emissions of 9 ppm NOₓ.",
        "The combustor and burner designs provide you with a world-class emission performance over a wide load range and are capable of single-digit NOₓ emission levels. The SGT-750 can guarantee 9 ppm NOₓ down to a 20% load. Designed to reduce environmental impact, the SGT-750 gas turbine will help you meet even the strictest emission regulations worldwide.",
        "The SGT-750 is the perfect option for power generation and offers a wide range of solutions, from stand-alone installations to complete power plants, industrial or oil and gas, onshore or offshore. The fast start-up and cycling capabilities support intermediate to continuous operation. Lightweight and compact design allows for quick installation and easy maintenance.",

        "The SGT-750 is delivered as a complete package, carefully designed to integrate supporting systems and customized solutions, ensuring a secured return on investment.",
        "Its modular build-up allows for swift disassembly and parts replacement, with a 24-hour engine swap time to minimize downtime. All package options are available as single lift and share the same driver for mechanical drive and power generation, enhancing operational reliability.",
        "The SGT-750's fast start-up and cycling capabilities support both intermediate and continuous operation with improved turndown capability.",
        "With its twin-shaft configuration, the SGT-750 is driving compressors or pumps either onshore or offshore. Minimized starting power needed.",
        "Small footprint due to compact design and highest availability – these are the best prerequisites for offshore applications as FLNG or FPSO.",
        "With maximized uptime, top-class performance, and a low environmental footprint, the SGT-750 industrial gas turbine offers you a high lifetime profitability and is a perfect choice for the oil and gas industry as well as industrial power generation. Fast start-up and cycling capabilities support both intermediate and continuous operation. We offer a wide range of solutions for power generation, from stand-alone installations to complete power plants for industrial and onshore or offshore power generation, and the oil and gas industry.",
        "Fast start-up and cycling capabilities support you from intermediate to continuous power generation.",
        "The SGT-750 is your perfect choice for combined cycle power plants for base load, standby power and peak lopping as well as cogeneration applications with heat load and district heating schemes.",
        "Our comprehensive service portfolio ensures low life cycle costs and optimal performance throughout the SGT-750's life cycle: ",
        "Serviceability and maximizing uptime were top priorities during the SGT-750's development.  The SGT-750 offers the highest operational availability with 68,000 equivalent operating hours (EOHs) to first major overhaul and a service plan requiring only 14 maintenance days in 17 years. Planned service can be executed on-site or off-site without the need for special workshops, and the time between overhauls can be easily extended when operating on lower loads.  Additionally, all SGT-750 models are monitored with infrared cameras during scheduled inspections and engine delivery tests.",
        "The enclosure is equipped with a traveling overhead crane allowing for easy offloading or loading on a truck.",
        "For maximized availability, the gas generator can be swapped in less than 24 hours. It can be rolled out with standard maintenance tools.",
        "The fourth-generation DLE burner allows for excellent fuel flexibility. Your SGT-750 will operate on gases with high content of inert gases, hydrogen or heavy hydrocarbons as required, without any impact on maintenance or emission levels. The engine is capable to burn up to 40 vol% of hydrogen (H2).",
        "The SGT-750 offers dual-fuel capability for all applications. It is designed to meet your individual operating criteria, including a reliable start, and changeover between fuels. The automatic changeover from gaseous to liquid fuel, and back again, can be executed at any load.",
        "Dry low emission technology allows for maximum fuel flexibility.",
        "The SGT-750 has dual-fuel and on-load fuel changeover capabilities.",
        "The SGT-750 is equipped with a fourth-generation Dry Low Emissions (DLE) system for clean combustion over a wide load range, ensuring a small environmental footprint. With this gas turbine you will comply with both global and regional regulations. The absence of burner staging allows for rapid load changes and the system is suitable for both liquid and gaseous fuels. The design gives a world-class emission performance over a wide load range with single-digit NOₓ capability.",
        "Emission requirements are meeting operational criteria including flexible fuel operation and reliable starting.",
        "Can combustors with double skin-cooled design are suitable for both liquid and gaseous fuels.",
        "The SGT-750 can be configured to any power rating from 38.9 to 41.1 MW.\n",
        "The SGT-750 can be configured to any power rating from 40 to 42.2 MW.",
