        "Siemens’ Remote Minor Inspection, part of the Remote Support suite, can allow you to maximize your industrial turbine availability by extending time between borescope inspections and decreasing the shut-down period for routine checks. At the same time, the risk to you is actually reduced due to our multiple, deep-dive analyzes over a longer period: 270 days of unit data compared to just 1 day with a traditional Minor Inspection!",
        "A remote inspection, of your SGT-600, SGT-700 and SGT-800, is carried out in Siemens’ dedicated analytics competence center, where your gas turbine and its components are compared against 15 million operating hours of fleet-wide data.\n\r\nA more personalized site inspection is performed based on the result of the remote analysis. Engineers come to your site already knowing the result of the analytics.",
