        "Power transformers have complex internal systems that degrade over time. As a consequence, it may be necessary to inspect the internal components for signs of abnormal operation. Hitachi Energy's TXplore™ accomplishes an internal inspection examining the structure of the transformer without the need to remove the oil and send an inspector into the confined space of a power transformer.",
        "Using the TXplore™ system avoids the danger of a spill when handling the oil and the risk of sending someone inside the transformer to perform an inspection. This can be accomplished during a brief outage versus conventional inspections requiring multiple days. Also, when a traditional internal inspection is complete, significant cost savings is accomplished by avoiding the oil handling and processing equipment needed to remove the oil and reprocess and fill the transformer.",
        "TXplore™ service can be scheduled ahead of time to take advantage of a planned outage with little or no increased downtime. It is also possible to deploy the service team to perform an inspection when unexpected issues are encountered.\n",
