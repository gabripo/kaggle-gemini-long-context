        "The current trend towards inverter-based power supplies, including renewables, batteries and other solutions, is changing the role of power electronics in the grid. As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​",
        "The ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​",
        "Staying below allowed voltage fluctuations​",
        "Power system equipment and loads require regulated voltage for proper operation. ​",
        "Staying below critical frequency levels​",
        "Frequency drift caused by fluctuations in generation or load must be mitigated. ​",
        "Lack of inertia​ ",
        "All generation resources must synchronize and remain synchronized through network disturbances.​",
        "Emergency reaction​",
        "System restoration, process of black starting and restoring the power system following a major outage.​",
        "Most power electronic systems today use grid following (GFL) inverter controls. Due to their widespread use and growing installed capacity, it is important to understand the characteristics, dynamic behavior and potential contribution to grid reliability of these inverters. Both grid-forming and grid-following controls aim to supply active and reactive power to the grid. However, their behavior during and after system disturbances differs.​",
