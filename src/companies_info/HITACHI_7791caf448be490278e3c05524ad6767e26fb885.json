        "Substation Assessment is a tailored program from Hitachi Energy that gives a detailed snapshot of the current situation of an existing or new to be built substation. Based on in-depth analysis and comparison of designs as well as a possible on-site assessment, Hitachi Energy experts will help define a concrete course of action to ensure a more reliable, sustainable and secure substation lifecycle.",
        "Hitachi Energy digs deep to assess substation health. Entering Substation Assesment is the first step towards Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), which focuses attention where condition is poor and the impact of failure is large, i.e., where risk is highest.",
        "A detailed assessment of the system",
        "A substation is a major investment that must be protected throughout its lifetime. Maintaining the reliability and availability of aging substation assets directly impacts the operations depending on them, from an electrical network to an industrial production process. Take care of these crucial investments by discovering Substation Assessment key values.",
        "Substation assessments help system operators to know the status and overall failure risk of a substation. It supports optimized maintenance strategies by focusing on improving functionality of key assets that will achieve the highest gain in overall substation reliability and availability. Reliability experts provide a technical report of the substation's overall status and of each key asset, providing technical decision support for any necessary upgrades or tailored maintenance plans. The report is also useful for third-party stakeholders, such as insurance companies and investors that are looking for a detailed picture of substation status.",
        "Ensuring reliable substation operation is crucial. Hitachi Energy collects most essential data and information through a visual inspection, which requires no outages and does not impact operations. Visits can be on site or done remotely. Hitachi Energy experts will discuss any substation issues, needs and experiences, and review available operational and diagnostic data.",
