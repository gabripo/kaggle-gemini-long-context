        "The Bushing Potential Device of Hitachi Energy is a capacitive voltage divider, which connects to the voltage tap of the condenser bushing. It uses the bushing’s capacitance and its own capacitors and inductors to provide an output voltage, which is proportional to and in phase with the bushing line-to-ground voltage. This output is commonly used to energize synchroscopes, voltmeters, and voltage-responsive relays. The device accuracy is not adequate for use with metering instruments where revenue is involved.",
