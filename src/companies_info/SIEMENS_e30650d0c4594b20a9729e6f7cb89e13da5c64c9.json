        "As a market leader for industrial steam turbines, we offer a comprehensive range of reliable and versatile steam turbines for the power output range from 2 to 250 MW. Our industrial steam turbines are designed for easy constructability, fast start-up and economical operation. The inlet steam pressure is 103 to 160 bar(a) and the inlet steam temperature is 400 to 565 °C.",
        "The SST-800 is a single casing steam turbine with center steam admission and reverse steam flow inner casing, designed for a direct coupled generator or mechanical drive.",
        "The highly customized turbine provides for an outstanding efficiency, fast start-up times and high reliability and availability. It supports all requirements for economical installation and operation in combination with highest flexibility for complex industrial processes. A double or even multicasing solution can also be provided.",
        "The SST-800 steam turbine can be used for both condensing and back-pressure applications.  Turbine auxiliary systems are also designed as pre-engineered modules covering the complete range of turbine sizes.",
        "The turbine can be arranged on a foundation or as a package (includung oil system and on a base frame). The SST-800 steam turbine design is in accordance with DIN or API standards.",
        "Typical Applications: ",
        "The SST-700 / 900 is a standard turbine solution with short delivery time due to its fixed pre-engineered design. Predefined modules enable a short manufacturing period, cost-efficient material supply and a fast ex-works delivery.",
        "The straight flow turbine solution with power output of up to 250 MW consists of a geared high-pressure steam turbine (backpressure), an intermediate / low-pressure steam turbine (condensing), both driving a generator installed in between.",
        "The dual casing reheat turbine configuration with inner casing is a competitive and optimized product for combined cycle power plants and concentrated solar power plants.",
        "We deliver a standard steam turbine generator set including the SST-600 (with or without gearbox), a generator, oil system, piping and instrumentation and the control system. The standard package can be extended to include a condenser, condensing plant or pre-heating system. The SST-600 with its reliable and flexible design is available with axial or radial exhaust.",
        "Mechanical Drive",
        "The SST-600 is also an efficient and economic mechanical drive. Since the 1970s, hundreds of projects have been successfully implemented all over the world using the SST-600 to directly drive everything from the smallest boiler feedwater pump just as reliably as the largest compressor even in the most complex processes. The SST-600 complies with regulations including the API standard.",
        "The SST-500 is a single casing, double exhaust flow steam turbine, which can be used as an entire drive or as the lowpressure module of a multiple-casing turboset, directly driven or geared. This turbine, with its capacity to operate over a wide range of speed and power, is ideal for large steam  volume  flows.  Steam flows into the turbine via two tangential inlets to equalize thermal loading and blade stress.",
        "Emergency stop valves and control valves are installed in the steam inlet pipes. The steam flows tangentially into the inner casing and then axially to both exhausts. The customized design of the steam path allows exact adjustment to surpass general physical limitations of the last stage blades. Double-end drive is available, if required, e.g. for booster pump drive",
        "The SST-400 is a single casing steam turbine, providing  geared or direct drive to 50 and 60 Hz generators, or to compressors and pumps. The symmetrical casing with horizontal joint flange enables the SST-400 to accept short start-up times and rapid load changes.",
        "The modular package design allows a wide variety of configurations to satisfy the customer’s individual needs in the most economical way. The utilization of selected proven components assures high reliability and easy maintenance.",
        "The SST-400 can be equipped with upward, downward or axial exhaust to fit with the selected installation. The turbine skid can be combined with a standardized gearbox, oil units, and generators to a turboset, according to the customer’s needs.  The turbine skid and gearbox/oil unit are fully assembled in the workshop before being shipped to the site. Our proven installation and maintenance concept lowers maintenance costs by enabling easy access to the installed components, the turbine, gearbox, and generator.",
        "The SST-300 is an optimal solution for a wide range of applications due to the implementation of the best technology combined with over 20 years of experience. In the last decade alone, this turbine has been installed in over 500 industrial and power applications by customers all over the world.",
        "All components and auxiliaries including the lube oil system are mounted on a common base frame. The turbine can be configured with either an upward, downward or axial exhaust orientation depending on the layout of the plant.",
        "The turbine can also accommodate multiple steam extraction / steam induction points as well. The compact design and simple layout of the turbine significantly reduce the cost and time associated with its construction, inspection and maintenance.",
        "The SST-200 is a single casing steam turbine provided in a packaged, skid-mounted configuration. It represents a solution based on long experience with both mechanical and generator drives and is characterized by ease of installation, facilitated by the modular package. The tailor-made, flexible steam turbine exactly fits to the customer needs.",
        "The Siemens SST-200 industrial steam turbine product line is based on the reaction blade technology. The turbine series follows a modular product philosophy, ensuring a high level of performance and reliability. The ability to combine standardized casing modules enable optimal design flexibility. This allows the turbine series to achieve high performance in combination with an optimal cost position.",
        "One of our key service goals is to minimize system downtime and resulting productivity losses  ",
        "Our stand-by heating system maintains the turbine at a high temperature during standstills and thereby greatly reduces the start-up time. Keeping the steam turbine generator units warm increases the remaining service time for the most important components, such as the turbine casing and the rotor. ",
