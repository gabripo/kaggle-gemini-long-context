        "With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, this 72.5 - 145 kV circuit breaker makes a greener grid achievable",
        "With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker.",
        "While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.",
        "The only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.",
        "The clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.\n",
        "At the same time, the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe.\n",

        "Zero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n",

        "At Hesseln substation, Germany, Siemens Energy and grid operator Westnetz are showing how innovation can drive decarbonization and digitalization in energy transmission.",
        "Implementation of the innovative vacuum switching technology in combination with a digitally enhanced circuit-breaker for transmission grid operator (TSO) ENEA.",
        "Dealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues.",
        "By Frank Jossi",
        "Netze BW, Noerdlingen, Germany",
        "While we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.",
        "Our high-voltage circuit breakers, regardless of type or voltage range, are designed in a well proven modular platform concept. This leads to a high diversity of types and high flexibility with regard to our customers’ requirements. They are available for single- and three-pole operation, either with a common base (FG) or with separate bases (FI) and can be equipped with optional closing resistors for applications from 362 kV up to 1100 kV. Moreover you can chose between porcelain or composite insulators.",
