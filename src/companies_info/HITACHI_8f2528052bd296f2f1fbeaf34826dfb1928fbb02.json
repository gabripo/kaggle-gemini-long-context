        "Hitachi Energy offers a wide portfolio of special application transformers for both AC and DC voltages. With years of experience, many references from different applications, and a global manufacturing footprint, Hitachi Energy has the experience needed to build the customer's special application transformer.  ",
        "By using only the highest available quality of materials for the core and winding, a reduction of losses has been achieved. For the end-user, this means that with lower losses, there is more energy to sell, which makes the payback time of the investment shorter. The lifetime of the transformer is also extended.\n",
        "This category includes liquid-filled and dry-type transformers for other applications not mentioned, like variable speed drives, furnace transformers, rectifiers, traction transformers, subsea transformers, and mobile transformers.",
