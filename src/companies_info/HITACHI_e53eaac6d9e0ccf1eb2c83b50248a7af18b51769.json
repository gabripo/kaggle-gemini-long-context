        "Based on many years of experience from complex installations, Hitachi Energy offers services to evolve or upgrade the installation to the next generation, to extend system lifetime, to improve availability and reliability and to avoid being outdated. There are several reasons to upgrade a system. First, many installations are critical for the supported system, transmission, or network. Additionally, there are challenges to maintain competence in limited and obsolete technologies when key staff members leave the company.",
        "Proactively upgrading the installation before a severe outage occurs can save time and money. The parts of a FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems) installations that are 15 years or older, may be in need of an upgrade.",
        "The need for upgrading depends mainly on the general condition of the equipment and the potential unavailability of spare parts. An upgrade may consist of a new control system, new functionality and a new generation of hardware and software.",
