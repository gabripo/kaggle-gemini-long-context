        "Realizing the benefits of an advanced power system management requires the automation of local operations, and the collection, evaluation, and forwarding of data on the power system status and plant condition to higher-level systems. The SAS600 station level solutions provide remote control and monitoring functions for all kinds of substations from distribution level to extra-high-voltage substations.",
        "Station Level Solutions provide a central database, HMI, and gateway functionality at the substation level. The substation communication networks are part of the solution. It inter-connects and integrates the bay level intelligent electronic devices (bay control and protection devices) using the well-proven IEC 61850 standard. They are easy to use and to adapt to customer-specific requirements.",
        "Power transmission substations are very often unmanned and can be physically distributed over quite a large area. They usually not only contain the high voltage level but also the sub-transmission and distribution as well. It is essential to have a common substation automation system for all voltage level that can provide reliable remote connection for operational purposes and to have a fast and secure remote access to data for incident analysis.",
        "Industrial customers have typically to cope with distribution substations spread over the entire area of a factory or a section of it. Transmission substations connecting the factories distribution network with the power grid may also be in the scope. Comprehensive solutions at the substation level is the key for reliable automation as well as local and remote control.",
