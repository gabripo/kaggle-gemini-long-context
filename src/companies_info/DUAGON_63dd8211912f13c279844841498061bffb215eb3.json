        "PCI Express Mini Card to M.2 Adapter",
        " The PX7 is a PCI Express Mini Card designed for converting form factor PCI Express Mini to M.2. In addition, it converts PCIe x1 on the PCI Express Mini side into USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 featured on the M.2 side.",
        "USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 Extension for Box PCs",
        " Typically, box PCs from duagon are equipped with PCI Express Mini Card slots which support PCIe x1 and USB 2.0 but not USB 3.2 Gen 1x1. The PX7 extends the capability of the box PC families by enabling the use of USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 devices (i.e. LTE-Advanced Modem) in M.2 form factor. The PX7 also supports one SIM card integrated in the box PCs.",
        "Fit for the Future",
        " The PX7 is the ideal solution for LTE Advanced, as it supports transmission rates of up to 500 Mbit/s (Cat 11/Cat 12). Optionally, the PX7 is also available as a USB 2.0 solution for slower LTE modems (Cat 6).",
        "Conduction Cooling Option",
        " duagon also offers a conduction cooled version of the PX7 including an LTE modem for the use within box PCs.",
