        "We at Siemens Energy's Subsea business unit have a portfolio tailored to support the industry on this journey. From our wide range of connectors and sensors to our large-scale subsea power distribution systems, we deliver the products and solutions that ensure our customers’ systems are connected and energized and that the large amount of data collected subsea is accurately and timely delivered to a control room or into a cloud solution. The end result for the customer is increased production, greater availability of systems, longer uptime and reduced CAPEX and OPEX. Our 40-year track record in serving the subsea oil and gas industry is a solid foundation for also supporting the offshore and subsea renewables industry in the coming energy transition.",
        "Decarbonization, digitalization, and electrification are three major trends in the oil and gas industry. These trends will influence the way forward with regard to infrastructure, products and processes across the oil and gas market. In addition, we are seeing the emergence of offshore and subsea renewable power generation and energy production and storage. ",
        "Enabling large-scale subsea processing by powering the subsea fields of the future – down to 3,000 meters.",
        "The subsea power grid components are “born digital” and equipped with sensors and high-quality data acquisition to enable full operational digital twins of the subsea power units. The data is stored in the cloud and on premise and data analytics is applied to the data to produce a hierarchy of health Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) for the subsea assets. This gives a very high level of transparency into the equipment and enables cost efficient operation and maintenance of the subsea power system.  ",
        "Our subsea products and systems portfolio covers a broad spectrum of applications. Going far beyond power and distribution, it comprises everything from pioneering technologies for subsea control and surveillance to exemplary service and support based on extensive marinization expertise. As a result, we are able to provide answers over the entire life of the field.",
        "Power generation represents most Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in the offshore oil & gas sector. On the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), offshore platforms produce around 18 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. It is estimated that around 75% of this is associated with electricity generation, primarily from gas turbine generators (GTGs).",
        "Ten years ago, a future where subsea fields and their power-hungry process equipment could be fully electrified, enabling long step-outs to tap remote reserves with lean new infrastructure architectures, lit the fuse for a spate of investment in subsea power distribution.",
