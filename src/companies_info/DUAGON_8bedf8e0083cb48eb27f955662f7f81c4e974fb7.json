        "The M72 M-Module is a timer, counter and comparator with four 32-bit counter units. The four counters work independently in several modes, e.g. counting decoder signals or measuring frequencies. Each counter can be loaded with a preset value and can generate several events. Events can set or reset output signals, which are optically isolated.",
        " The mezzanine card M72 can also be used to generate timed signals. In addition it features line-break detection. The sensor signals are optically isolated and can be used as TTL, RS422 or 24 V inputs.",
        " The M72 is based on the M-Module ANSI mezzanine standard. It can be used as an I/O extension in any type of bus system, i.e. CPCI, VME or on any type of stand-alone SBC. Appropriate M-Module carrier cards in 3U, 6U and other formats are available from duagon or other manufacturers.",
