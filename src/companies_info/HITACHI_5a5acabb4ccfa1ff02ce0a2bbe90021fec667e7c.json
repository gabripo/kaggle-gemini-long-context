        "Our bushings are an essential component of AC transformers and reactors, helping to ensure that these critical pieces of equipment operate safely and reliably over the long term.",
        "Hitachi Energy bushings are electrical insulation components that are designed for AC transformers and reactors. They typically provide a high-voltage connection between the transformer or reactor and an external circuit while also ensuring that the high-voltage is safely insulated from the surrounding environment.",
        "Hitachi Energy bushings are made to specifically fulfill the needs of AC reactors and transformers, which run at high voltages and currents. They are typically constructed from premium materials that can handle severe electrical and mechanical stresses, such as porcelain or composite materials.",
        "The bushings come in various forms, including oil-filled and dry-type bushings, and are compatible with a wide range of transformers and reactors. Oil-filled bushings are commonly utilized in transformers with liquid insulation, whereas dry-type bushings are employed in transformers with solid insulation.​",
        "Hitachi Energy bushings are built to withstand various environmental conditions, including high temperatures, humidity, and vibration. They are also engineered to exceed international requirements for safety and reliability. Additionally, they are made to be simple to install and maintain, and they come with various features, such as monitoring systems and diagnostic tools, that can help identify possible faults before they escalate into more significant difficulties.",
        "Not sure about your perfect fit? Our product catalog provides easy access to detailed information about all our bushings for AC applications and more.",
        "No matter the issue, our teams are on hand to help.",
        "Our sales team will get in touch with you",
        "Powered by our vast experience from designing thousands of bushings, AirRIP® flex reveals a new universe of solutions. Enabling transformer manufacturers and operators to accelerate their value creation endeavors, AirRIP® flex delivers customized and certified bushings through an efficient purchasing process & product delivery, easy installation, and product upgrade facilities. AirRIP® flex bushings are completely dry, explosion-proof, and fire-resistant, allowing high application temperatures.  AirRIP® flex is produced in a wide variety of designs and can easily fulfill specific customer requirements.",
        "HIRIP outdoor transformer bushings are designed for the most demanding high-current applications. The dry bushing technology provides users with safety and quality performance uniquely combined with thermal and electrical engineering developments for applications up to 40,000 amperes. Hitachi Energy has access to comprehensive resources, especially in high-voltage engineering, materials research, and applied physics. The continuously improved design of our RIP high-voltage bushings sets new standards regarding quality, reliability, and safety.",
        "Through continuous investments in research & development, Hitachi Energy became the inventor of the paperless, Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) bushing technology. In our flagship EasyDry® RIS line, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.",
