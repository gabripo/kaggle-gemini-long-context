        "For In-System Mobile Phone Functionality",
        " The PX4 is a Full-Mini PCI Express Mini Card providing an interface for mobile wireless functions including audio. It is built in a stacked structure, consisting of one PCI Express Mini Card to connect on a carrier board and one mezzanine card for another plug-on PCI Express Mini Card.",
        "Supports Mini-SIM and LTE",
        " The PX4 provides a mini-SIM card slot. If a mini-SIM card is mounted and, e.g., a 4G LTE modem for mobile phone functionality is assembled as plug-on PCI Express Mini Card, the PX4 extends the wireless data communication with audio. This allows, e.g., the train driver to make phone calls via mobile wireless cards.",
        "Usable in Harsh Environments",
        " The wide temperature range of -40°C to +85°C and the availability of a product model with conformal coating makes the PX4 especially suited for use in the rail and public transport market.",
