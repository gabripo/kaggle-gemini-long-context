            "The F75P is a COTS safe computer with onboard functional safety that unites three CPUs on one 3U CompactPCI PlusIO card. It makes Intel Atom E6xx (\"E600\") performance with dual redundancy extremely compact, mainly targeting railway applications. Two independent Control Processors (CP) with independent DDR2 RAM and Flash and a supervision structure provide safety: For SIL 3 / SIL 4: With redundant software running on F75P and, e.g., with the software instances on the two CPs comparing their output. This way the board becomes a fail-silent subsystem, i.e. it can shut down in case of a fatal fault.",
            " For up to SIL 2: Using just one of the two CPs or using both CPs independently for different applications. This way on each CP a 1oo1D safety application up to SIL 2 can be realized.",
            " Its I/O Processor (IOP) is built up like a classic CompactPCI CPU board, including DDR2 RAM, front and rear I/O. The front connectors include VGA, two USB 2.0, and two 100-Mbit Ethernet channels. At the rear, the board provides another four USB 2.0, two Fast Ethernet ports, one 3-Gbit SATA and one PCI Express x1 link. These interfaces comply with the standardized pinout of CompactPCI PlusIO (PICMG 2.30). An onboard mSATA slot makes for scalable, robust mass storage. The intelligent board management controller of the IOP logs events such as reset, overvoltage or undervoltage in a non-volatile FRAM.",
            " The Control (CP) and I/O Processors (IOP) communicate via internal links provided by an FPGA. The CPs are designed to run a deterministic real-time operating system such as the QNX Neutrino RTOS Safe Kernel. It is also possible to implement diversitary software on both kernels. All three CPUs support Linux and QNX.",
            " The F75P can replace multiprocessing systems with CPU redundancy and I/O by a small-footprint, low-power solution that is flexible for different types of application scenarios. It uses a single +5 V supply voltage to allow operation with external power supplies that do not generate +3.3 V.",
            " F75P-based systems are generally certifiable up to SIL 4. Since the card has no voter of its own, the software implements and controls functional safety behavior. The customer can either add the software himself or purchase it from duagon. The safety features such as the CP supervisors are designed to SIL 4 according to [EN50129]. A railway certification package including the \"safety case\" document and a certificate from TÜV SÜD is available.",

The integrated Ethernet controllers, designed by duagon, feature hardware prioritisation and very low jitter. The chip-sized, space-saving component encapsulates all Ethernet relevant functions on a small 48 x 50 mm size footprint. It can be considered a communication chip that handles various Ethernet protocols. The D013E lowers the requirements to the host system, as there is no need for additional CPU power for the Ethernet stack. Moreover, the main application does not need to share CPU power with complex Ethernet protocol stacks.",

It supports various Ethernet protocols like TRDP, TRDP with SDTv2, CIP, IPTCom, PROFINET, UDP or TCP/IP. Different kinds of web services are optionally available. An optional internal switch allows to build daisy chains and to run the appropriate ring protocols. The drivers for the bypass relays are also included (bypass relays themselves are not included). The component integrates the magnetics with a galvanic insulation, the PHY, the complete protocol controller and a simple host interface.",
            " With duagon’s driver kit the D013E, featuring an easy-to-use UART emulation, can be integrated very quickly on almost any host system through a small register set (each 8-bit long). The D013E does not need a wide address range compared with a solution based on dual ported memory. Different host interfaces like serial (RS/TX), 8bit-parallel or SPI are configurable by bootstrapping pins. The digital interfaces act on 3.3V logic levels fitting most of the modern CPU platforms.",

Supporting different types of the i.MX 6Solo, 6DualLite, 6Dual and 6Quad families, the computer-on-module is widely scalable, e.g., to processing or graphics requirements. Where less performance is needed, you can optimize costs by choosing a single- or dual-core processor instead of a quad core.",

The exclusive use of soldered components ensures that the COM withstands shock and vibration. The design is optimized for conformal coating. Adding to its rugged design, the computer-on-module's range of supported functions leave almost nothing to wish for.

Different video outputs like LVDS and HDMI/DVI, audio and an optional camera interface make the card fit for multimedia applications. Other serial ports provide UARTs or CAN bus. Where the processor's standard functions are not a perfect match, an onboard FPGA opens up 140 signal pins for user I/O. As IP cores are easy to integrate, the CC10 becomes a semi-custom solution with the suitable functionality even for more specialized applications. The resulting I/O functionality in the ordered version depends on the customer's requirements and will always be a tailored combination of i.MX 6 and FPGA-based I/O, without the need for a completely new design.

Supporting different types of the i.MX 6Solo, 6DualLite, 6Dual and 6Quad families, the computer-on-module is widely scalable, e.g., to processing or graphics requirements. Where less performance is needed, you can optimize costs by choosing a single- or dual-core processor instead of a quad core.",
            "Perfect for Harsh Environments ",
            " For applications that need reliable operation even under the harshest environmental conditions, a specially hardened version is available - the CC10C. CC10C modules are embedded in a closed aluminum frame that ensures optimum EMC protection and efficient conduction cooling and supports an extended operating temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. Direct air cooling is possible by placing a heat sink on the cover. The innovative mechanical design around the COM.0 electronics makes it an ultra-rugged module. With the mechanics for conduction cooling, the module's size extends to 105 x 105 mm. The CC10 is based on the \"Compact\", 95 x 95 mm form factor and Type 6 connector pin-out. The exclusive use of soldered components ensures that the COM withstands shock and vibration. The design is optimized for conformal coating. Adding to its rugged design, the computer-on-module's range of supported functions leave almost nothing to wish for. With a maximum of 4 GB DDR3 RAM and an onboard eMMC device, the CC10 covers all basic memory needs. 3-Gbit SATA is provided for external mass storage.",

The i.MX 6 provides an abundance of onchip controllers and interfaces, including Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 (also with OTG/client support) and PCI Express. Different video outputs like LVDS and HDMI/DVI, audio and an optional camera interface make the card fit for multimedia applications. Other serial ports provide UARTs or CAN bus. Where the processor's standard functions are not a perfect match, an onboard FPGA opens up 140 signal pins for user I/O. As IP cores are easy to integrate, the CC10 becomes a semi-custom solution with the suitable functionality even for more specialized applications. The resulting I/O functionality in the ordered version depends on the customer's requirements and will always be a tailored combination of i.MX 6 and FPGA-based I/O, without the need for a completely new design.

            "The F75P is a COTS safe computer with onboard functional safety that unites three CPUs on one 3U CompactPCI PlusIO card. It makes Intel Atom E6xx (\"E600\") performance with dual redundancy extremely compact, mainly targeting railway applications. Two independent Control Processors (CP) with independent DDR2 RAM and Flash and a supervision structure provide safety: For SIL 3 / SIL 4: With redundant software running on F75P and, e.g., with the software instances on the two CPs comparing their output. This way the board becomes a fail-silent subsystem, i.e. it can shut down in case of a fatal fault.",
            " For up to SIL 2: Using just one of the two CPs or using both CPs independently for different applications. This way on each CP a 1oo1D safety application up to SIL 2 can be realized.",
            " Its I/O Processor (IOP) is built up like a classic CompactPCI CPU board, including DDR2 RAM, front and rear I/O. The front connectors include VGA, two USB 2.0, and two 100-Mbit Ethernet channels. At the rear, the board provides another four USB 2.0, two Fast Ethernet ports, one 3-Gbit SATA and one PCI Express x1 link. These interfaces comply with the standardized pinout of CompactPCI PlusIO (PICMG 2.30). An onboard mSATA slot makes for scalable, robust mass storage. The intelligent board management controller of the IOP logs events such as reset, overvoltage or undervoltage in a non-volatile FRAM.",
            " The Control (CP) and I/O Processors (IOP) communicate via internal links provided by an FPGA. The CPs are designed to run a deterministic real-time operating system such as the QNX Neutrino RTOS Safe Kernel. It is also possible to implement diversitary software on both kernels. All three CPUs support Linux and QNX.",
            " The F75P can replace multiprocessing systems with CPU redundancy and I/O by a small-footprint, low-power solution that is flexible for different types of application scenarios. It uses a single +5 V supply voltage to allow operation with external power supplies that do not generate +3.3 V.",
            " F75P-based systems are generally certifiable up to SIL 4. Since the card has no voter of its own, the software implements and controls functional safety behavior. The customer can either add the software himself or purchase it from duagon. The safety features such as the CP supervisors are designed to SIL 4 according to [EN50129]. A railway certification package including the \"safety case\" document and a certificate from TÜV SÜD is available.",

The SA concept allows to add additional I/O interfaces to many of MEN's CPU boards and box PCs, enhancing flexibility with regard to the line transceivers and isolation requirements. Whether a specific SA-Adapter (or a mix of different SA-Adapters) fits on a specific CPU board is determined by a combination of mechanical, performance, FPGA and operating system criteria and needs to be verified for every board configuration requested."

            " The CC10 is an Ultra-Rugged COM Express module built around the NXP (formerly Freescale) ARM i.MX 6 series of processors with a Cortex-A9 architecture. Supporting different types of the i.MX 6Solo, 6DualLite, 6Dual and 6Quad families, the computer-on-module is widely scalable, e.g., to processing or graphics requirements. Where less performance is needed, you can optimize costs by choosing a single- or dual-core processor instead of a quad core.",
            "Perfect for Harsh Environments ",
            " For applications that need reliable operation even under the harshest environmental conditions, a specially hardened version is available - the CC10C. CC10C modules are embedded in a closed aluminum frame that ensures optimum EMC protection and efficient conduction cooling and supports an extended operating temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. Direct air cooling is possible by placing a heat sink on the cover. The innovative mechanical design around the COM.0 electronics makes it an ultra-rugged module. With the mechanics for conduction cooling, the module's size extends to 105 x 105 mm. The CC10 is based on the \"Compact\", 95 x 95 mm form factor and Type 6 connector pin-out. The exclusive use of soldered components ensures that the COM withstands shock and vibration. The design is optimized for conformal coating. Adding to its rugged design, the computer-on-module's range of supported functions leave almost nothing to wish for. With a maximum of 4 GB DDR3 RAM and an onboard eMMC device, the CC10 covers all basic memory needs. 3-Gbit SATA is provided for external mass storage.",
            "I/O Flexibility ",
            " One of the biggest strengths of the CC10 lies in its I/O flexibility. The i.MX 6 provides an abundance of onchip controllers and interfaces, including Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 (also with OTG/client support) and PCI Express. Different video outputs like LVDS and HDMI/DVI, audio and an optional camera interface make the card fit for multimedia applications. Other serial ports provide UARTs or CAN bus. Where the processor's standard functions are not a perfect match, an onboard FPGA opens up 140 signal pins for user I/O. As IP cores are easy to integrate, the CC10 becomes a semi-custom solution with the suitable functionality even for more specialized applications. The resulting I/O functionality in the ordered version depends on the customer's requirements and will always be a tailored combination of i.MX 6 and FPGA-based I/O, without the need for a completely new design. For evaluation and development purposes a microATX carrier board, the XC15, is available.",

            "The D013E is a multi-purpose dual Ethernet controller interface with embedded processing power. The integrated Ethernet controllers, designed by duagon, feature hardware prioritisation and very low jitter. The chip-sized, space-saving component encapsulates all Ethernet relevant functions on a small 48 x 50 mm size footprint. It can be considered a communication chip that handles various Ethernet protocols. The D013E lowers the requirements to the host system, as there is no need for additional CPU power for the Ethernet stack. Moreover, the main application does not need to share CPU power with complex Ethernet protocol stacks.",
            " The D013E is fully compliant with IEEE 802.3 and supports features like Auto Polarity, Auto Negotiation and Auto-DI-X.",
            " The D013E is prepared for the future “Ethernet on traction vehicles” standard IEC 61375-3-4. It supports various Ethernet protocols like TRDP, TRDP with SDTv2, CIP, IPTCom, PROFINET, UDP or TCP/IP. Different kinds of web services are optionally available. An optional internal switch allows to build daisy chains and to run the appropriate ring protocols. The drivers for the bypass relays are also included (bypass relays themselves are not included). The component integrates the magnetics with a galvanic insulation, the PHY, the complete protocol controller and a simple host interface.",
            " With duagon’s driver kit the D013E, featuring an easy-to-use UART emulation, can be integrated very quickly on almost any host system through a small register set (each 8-bit long). The D013E does not need a wide address range compared with a solution based on dual ported memory. Different host interfaces like serial (RS/TX), 8bit-parallel or SPI are configurable by bootstrapping pins. The digital interfaces act on 3.3V logic levels fitting most of the modern CPU platforms.",
            " The D013E is designed for harsh rolling stock environments and is fully compliant with EN 50155."

ESM modules are based on PCI. They have two system connectors: J1 has a fixed signal assignment, while J2 is variable depending on the final application-specific configuration of the ESM and the carrier board. J2 also feeds the I/O signals of the functions programmed in the FPGA to the carrier card."
