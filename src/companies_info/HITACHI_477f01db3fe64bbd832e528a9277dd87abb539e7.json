        "The Hitachi Energy GOE bushing is an oil-impregnated condenser bushing for transformer oil-air application, which is available in two designs. The classic GOE line of bushings is available for the entire voltage range from 52 to 1200 kV. The GOE (2) line of bushings provides a lighter weight and more compact bushing for lower current ratings and is available for three specific voltage classes: 362, 420, and 550 kV. The maximum rated current for GOE is 5000 A, and for GOE (2), it is 1600 A, depending on size.",
