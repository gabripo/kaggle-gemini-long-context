        "Providing a future-proof source of electricity and contributing to lower CO₂ emissions, power produced from biomass is increasingly economically viable. The interests of operators and investors, on the one hand, and those of utilities and grids, on the other, are becoming more closely aligned. This is because ensuring a stable power supply as well as the financial success of the power plant are common goals. ",
        "The biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built. It will apply novel process innovations to sustainably convert 100 percent wood into bio-based mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), mono-propylene glycol (MPG) as well as renewable functional fillers (RFF). ",
        "With more widespread environmental awareness and the resultant striving for “green” lifestyles, biomass energy for both industry and electricity providers is a reliable – and sustainable – source of baseload power.",
        "It also helps in meeting environmental targets, absorbing more CO₂ than it emits, and efficient equipment used in power generation leads to fewer emissions at the plant site.",
        "Biomass is a relatively cheap base load and, depending on the local regulations, surplus electricity produced from it can be fed back to the grid, making it even more economically viable.",
        "Installing a biomass power plant to burn the on-site waste that occurs as a by-product of industrial processes closes the factory input cycle.",
        "It also eliminates the need for waste disposal, lowers energy costs and maintains a high availability of the power supply.",
        "Incinerating renewables is thus a further step toward sustainability and toward a closed-cycle economy. These by-products need no additional processing, further strengthening the financial feasibility of the biomass plant.",
        "The possibility of running a biomass plant on diverse feedstocks adds to the viability of such projects while ensuring the availability of the fuel supply.",
        "Apart from achieving maximum output with a minimum of life-cycle costs, another decisive economic factor is the need for appropriate frameworks already in the country concerned, regulating such variables as electricity prices, the level of tipping tax, and funding.",
        "With their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint.\n",

        "Industries producing a large amount of process (biomass) waste can convert it into carbon-neutral energy to power their facilities or sell into the grid for additional revenue.",
        "Reheat solutions significantly increase the overall efficiency of a biomass plant and are therefore an optimal solution to produce more energy without having to use more fuel.",
