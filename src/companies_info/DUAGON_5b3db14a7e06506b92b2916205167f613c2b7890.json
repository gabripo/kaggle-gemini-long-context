        "The BL70W is a fanless, maintenance-free box computer that has been designed for independent use or as display computer electronics for embedded wireless applications in transportation, e.g. in trains, commercial vehicles, mobile machines or airplanes.",
        " The BL70W is powered by an Intel Core i7-3517UE CPU, running at 1.7 GHz. Other processors of the 3rd generation Intel Core i7 family can be used which makes for high scalability in CPU (single/dual/quad core) performance.",
        " The BL70W is equipped with 4 GB of DDR3 SDRAM and offers microSD card and mSATA slots.",
        "Wireless Communication",
        " Four PCI Express Mini Card slots each with dual micro-SIM make it possible to flexibly implement the whole range of wireless interfaces such as mobile service standards up to 4G LTE or WLAN/WLAN IEEE 802.11, and derivates. A GNSS interface supporting positioning systems GPS and GLONASS complements the possibilities.",
        "Fanless Operation for Mobile Applications",
        " The system is designed for fanless operation at temperatures from -40 °C to +70 °C (+85 °C for up to 10 minutes), its special rugged aluminum housing with cooling fins serves as a heat sink for the internal electronics and in this way provides conduction cooling.",
        "Railway-Compliant PSU with Ignition Function",
        " The BL70W comes with its own integrated 30W 24 VDC nom. class S2 wide-range power supply and is in compliance with EN 50155 and ISO 7637-2 (E-mark for automotive). The power can be switched on and off using an ignition signal on the power connector, and a run-down time after switching off the ignition signal can be adjusted by software.",
        "Flexible System Design",
        " The various CPU options with the available selection of external interfaces (realized via separate graphics and I/O interface boards within the system) makes for an extremely flexible system design that can quickly be tailored to a vast number of applications.",
        " The BL70W supports up to two DisplayPort interfaces with full HD resolution. In addition, a multitude of other I/O is available at the front panel, including two Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0, variable slots for legacy serial I/O (e.g. RS232) or CAN bus, general purpose inputs and relay outputs.",
