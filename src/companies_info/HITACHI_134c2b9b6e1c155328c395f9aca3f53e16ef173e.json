        "Through continuous investments in Research & Development, Hitachi Energy became the inventor of the paperless, Resin Impregnated Synthetics (RIS) bushing technology. In our flagship RIS line EasyDryÂ®, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.\n",
        "Hitachi Energyâ€™s paperless RIS bushings are made of a synthetic non-woven material that is wound around a conductor with aluminum foil inserts for electrical stress control. The core is afterward vacuum-impregnated with epoxy resin and cured, giving a partial discharge-free dry bushing.",
        "This paperless bushing technology has an advanced insulation performance due to its non-hygroscopic insulation that is not sensitive to moisture ingress and absorption. In addition, RIS bushings will have a superior effect on the power factor (dielectric losses), and the intrinsic aging behavior leading to an extended product lifetime.",
