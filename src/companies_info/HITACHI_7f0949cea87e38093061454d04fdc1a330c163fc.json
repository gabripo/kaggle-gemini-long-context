        "To minimize the environmental impact of ports in the light of increasing goods and passenger traffic as well as ever more stringent emissions regulations, ship and port owners and operators are seeking ways to improve energy efficiency, productivity and sustainability of port operations. Fresh thinking leads to the advent of smart port concepts, expanding on the successful shore-to-ship power supply solutions. Deployment of smart port infrastructure and shore-to ship power systems helps to make ports and shipping companies even more competitive, ecologically viable and profitable.",
