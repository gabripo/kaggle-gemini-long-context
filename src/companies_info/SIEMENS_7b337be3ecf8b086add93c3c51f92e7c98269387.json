        "Electrical supply and power management rolled into one",
        "In the fiber business as in other industries, electrical power supply requirements are becoming more and more complex. In addition to the traditional need to reliably, safely, and economically distribute electricity from the generator or incoming grid down to the consumers, there are new emerging challenges, including the need to implement governmental directives to save power, and to utilize the growing amount of renewable energy that's being fed into the grid, which is making grid control increasingly complex. The latter can result in voltage fluctuations and even cause plant downtime. Industrial Grid and Energy Management allows you to safely and reliably engineer, plan, and realize your factory power distribution system while providing you with the tools to meet today's new demands and challenges.",
        "Industrial power distribution is a fully integrated power distribution and management system for planning and monitoring the power supply for the complete process chain in your paper factory. This also includes a power supply for black starts and emergency power operation. In conjunction with intelligent control and switching devices and our integrated communications network, indsutrial power distribution offers the right technical solutions for all of your requirements: high availability, adequate supply capacity, expandability and scalability, consistently high power quality, and environmental compatibility. It goes without saying that it's also economical, saves resources, and is easy to operate.",
        "Industrial power distribution includes all the necessary components to build a complex power distribution system for your mill, including power and distribution transformers, HV, MV, and LV switchgear in AIS or GIS versions, and appropriate protection systems.",
        "Thanks to sophisticated power control technology, Industrial Power Distribution always gives you an overview of all processes in your electrical installations and provides you with essential service information. The system monitors and records all switching processes throughout your entire factory using smart devices like IMOCODE, SIPROTEC control, and fiber-optic networks for field-bus communication. This allows you to predict load requirements and inform the operator or take action to prevent the mill's power demand from rising to unacceptably high load peaks that result in extra charges.",
        "Industrial Power Distribution stands for power supply solutions from a single source – fully integrated and coordinated, across all voltage levels, and over the entire lifecycle. The network design starts with the collection of all relevant mill data, including consumer power requirements, starting characteristics of large drives, short-circuit capacity of all components, and grid parameters. Other criteria need to be considered in the engineering,for example, emergency and back-up concepts, mill availability and grid requirements. Finally to verify the mill's design and optimize the recovery time after a mill network or grid supply fault, dynamic network simulations based on fault scenarios are created to guarantee maximum reliability.",
        "Power Intelligence is a comprehensive portfolio of digital products and solutions from Siemens Energy. These are designed to enable power utilities and industries to unlock the full potential of their electrical infrastructure. They provide insightful data for decision-making, enhance asset management, improve reliability and efficiency, and reduce operational costs.",
        "The pulp and paper industry has already taken a leading role in the closed-cycle economy by making optimal use of resources, integrating waste products into processes, optimizing energy requirements, transforming into a self-sufficient energy cycle, and using digitalization tools.",
        "We know the importance of a flexible steam turbine design and customization. That is why we provide steam turbines with various uncontrolled and controlled extraction options adapted to the steam flow in your process. We can offer the precise number of extractions indicated by your process requirements.",
        "The Yankee drying process is the most common drying method. Small gas turbines are desirable for use in the Yankee process because the demand for hot air is lower compared with the Through Air Dryer (TAD) process. TAD uses heat to dewater the product instead of the conventional mechanical pressing. This produces a much softer paper and reduces the demand for raw material from 8% to 30%, but dramatically increases the drying load. The high demand of hot air means that the implementation of gas turbines up to 10 MW is profitable for the TAD process.",
        "Our Pulp and Paper Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle, and allow you to exploit the opportunities of digitalization while reducing your total cost of ownership. Our services include:",
        "With our solutions, we help to ensure success in the pulp and paper industry worldwide.",
        "At Progroup Paper AG’s paper factory of in Sandersdorf- Brehna, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, one of the most modern paper machines (PM3) is producing high-quality containerboard from wastepaper. We supply the power distribution and electrification, including the Process Control and Safety System  on Simatic PCS 7, as well as a multi-motor drive solution based on gearless drives.",
        "Any questions about energy systems? Let our fiber industry experts help you find the optimal solution for your specific requirements.",
