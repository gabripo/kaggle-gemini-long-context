        "Monitoring improves the reliability of the assets by constantly keeping a watchful eye on the most critical transformer components. Online monitoring effectively increases performance, reduces failure risks, and cuts maintenance costs. Compared to traditional diagnostic methods performed on-site with the transformer de-energized, monitoring gives you, the asset owner, access to real-time condition information, even from remote locations. When changes in conditions are detected, you are notified immediately.",
