        "Tomorrow’s power grid will not be centralized, predictable, and structured. Instead, it will be flexible and scalable with modular sub-systems, complemented with distributed energy sources, microgrids, battery storage, and more.",
        "This will dramatically increase the need to optimize energy both locally and system-wide leading to a complex “system of systems” that must be integrated and managed.",
        "Digitalization is the only way to manage this complexity and simplify the contextualization of the data that will be generated.",
        "Our customers have confirmed that digitalization is a required enabler of the energy transition.  But they also need to see real value from their digitalization efforts now, leveraging data that they are already collecting about their assets.\n",

        "David Goddard,\r\nHead of Digital, Hitachi Energy",
        "For forward-thinking energy owners, operators, providers and consumers alike, digitalization provides essential tools needed to navigate the energy transition. But industry leaders can’t focus solely on the future while forgetting the now – all of this must be balanced with managing and optimizing today’s operations.\n",
        "That’s why now is the time to unlock value from the ground up.",

        "Asset intensive industries such as mining, metals, and oil and gas have powered the global economy for well over a century.",
        "Now, these industries are digitally transforming their operations to reduce their impact on the environment, optimize and increase asset lifespan, reduce failure rate and asset downtime while increasing competitiveness by becoming more agile and making more data-driven decisions.",
        "Renewable energy the fastest-growing source of power generation and is essential if we are to deliver a carbon-neutral future.",
        "Tomorrow’s grid will not be centralized, predictable, and structured.",
        "Instead, it will be flexible and scalable with modular sub-systems, complemented with distributed energy sources, microgrids, battery storage, prosumers and EVs.",
        "Digitalization is the only way to manage this complexity and generate real ROI.",
        "The demands for sustainable transportation, maximum uptime, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are all increasing.",
        "Solutions that consume less energy and deliver more uptime at the lowest cost possible are crucial to keeping this sector moving.",
        "Air, eMobility, marine and rail are all undergoing a digital transformation.",
        "Digitalization solutions empower TPOs with visibility over their entire network and operations, agility to respond quickly to unplanned outages, adapt to supply/demand fluctuations, and maintain critical assets.",
        "Utilities are leading the energy transition, enabling greater access to sustainable electricity and like many industries, are undergoing a digital transformation.",
        "Digitalization is empowering utilities to better predict the asset health, prevent failure of equipment, avoid unplanned downtime and unforeseen costs, and maximize safety through remote asset monitoring.",
