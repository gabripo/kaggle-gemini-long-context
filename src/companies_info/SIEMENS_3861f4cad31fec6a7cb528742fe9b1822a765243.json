        "Learn more about the range and technology of our high-voltage disconnectors and earthing switches. Our high-voltage disconnectors and earthing switches combine state-of-the-art technology with the highest quality standards for a voltage range from 36 kV to 800 kV.",
        "Most important features:",
        "Advantages:",
        "The center break is the most frequently used disconnector type worldwide. Its design is characterized by two rotating insulators that open and close the contacts in a sideways motion.",
        "Most important features and advantages:",
        "Double side break disconnectors are primarily used in substations with limited phase space and where a vertical opening of the current path is not possible. The current path makes a horizontal rotating movement.",
        "Pantographs require the smallest possible mounting space and are connected to the busbar with its characteristic scissors.",
        "The current path of the vertical break disconnector opens in the vertical direction, making small phase distances possible. Vertical break disconnectors carry out two movements: a vertical swinging movement, and a rotary movement around its own longitudinal axis.",
        "The technology of our products sets international trends. We continuously ensure our high quality through optimized production processes, constant product development and a certified quality management system.",
        "All device/construction types consist of the same basic components and are mostly identical:",
        "* except for pantographs\r\n** except for center break disconnectors",
        "Our contact systems offer the following advantages: ",
        "3DN1N00 Application",
        "Latest center break disconnector development focused on optimizing the base frame with a current path of S00",
        "3DN1S00 Application",
        "Latest current path optimization combines our classic contact system (R00) and modern current path arm (I00)",
        "3DN1R00 Application",
        "Classic contact system with classic current path arm",
        " 3DN1I00 Application",
        "3DN1B00 Application",
        "Our drive systems offer the following advantages:",
        "It consists of three main components: the housing, the gear unit with motor, and the electrical equipment with auxiliary switch. A motor-integrated transmission ensures maintenance-free operation and security, as well as low noise levels.",
        "It is characterized by its main components, such as the housing and electrical equipment, as well as the operation using the lockable hand lever, which ensures the highest possible safety during maintenance and service work.",
        "It consists of main components such as the housing and electrical equipment, and offers a special advantage: It collects signals and centralizes single pole operating mechanisms or disconnector and earthing operating mechanisms.",
        "Our global production network ensures that we are always reachable and close to our customers. This reduces transportation costs and delivery times, and also improves our carbon footprint.",
        "You can find details on our disconnectors and earthing switches and information about our services here.",
