        "We provide availability of up to 99 % for high-voltage DC transmission",
        "Siemens Energy high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission has proven its high performance and reliability for many years. Nevertheless, during the long lifecycle of HVDC, various services are required to support its optimalfunctionality and the economically safe operation throughout the years.",
        "Bringing energy from remote renewable energy generators to consumers and providing compensation for regional fluctuations in the production or consumption of electricity thanks to trans-national grid connections: HVDC transmission operators have to make sure their system provides the highest availability, performance, and efficiency at all times. One pillar to fulfill this challenge is our best-in-class HVDC hardware and software, but that alone is not enough to guarantee efficiency, security, and reliability for decades. Your system also needs regular maintenance, modernization, security checks and updates.",
        "Siemens Energy can provide you with comprehensive services to increase the transparency of your HVDC system as a prerequisite for optimization and to ensure continuous availability as well as the highest possible performance.",
        "Are you looking for preventive and corrective maintenance, sophisticated spare parts management, and modernization or retrofitting of older systems? If so, we will be at your side with our specific HVDC know-how and a wide-ranging service portfolio to ensure a highly available, secure, and cost-efficient HVDC operation as well as compliance with environmental and safety regulations.",
        "Siemens Energy offers you a wide range of individualized services for your HVDC system, including our cyber security services for reliable and secure HVDC systems of the future",
        "Cyber threats are increasing with serious consequences for companies and communities worldwide. Critical infrastructure, such as power transmission systems, is increasingly becoming the main focus.",
        "Today, IT systems are the foundation of critical processes for most companies. This leads to significantly increased risks of being attacked by hackers or viruses, and patching software weaknesses is not a onetime task but an ongoing endeavor throughout the system’s lifetime. For these reasons, Siemens Energy has developed a comprehensive cyber security service portfolio for HVDC to support you.",
        "From reactive to proactive services, from repair and spare parts to service programs – our service portfolio for all kinds of high-voltage DC systems covers everything you need to keep your system up and running efficiently and up to date. See comprehensive details for our HVDC services below.",
        "We successfully deliver fast, competent, and reliable product support for high-voltage DC transmission to all corners of the earth.",
        "Do you need help on a concrete project? Do you need a quote for any of our products or solutions? Do you need support for your installed equipment? Do you have a technical question? Do you need something totally different? You can contact us 24/7. We are looking forward to your request.",
