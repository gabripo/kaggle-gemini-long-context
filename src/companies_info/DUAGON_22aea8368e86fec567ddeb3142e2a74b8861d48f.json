        "Extension for Various Applications",
        " The ME1 is a modular extension for embedded applications in transportation, e.g., in trains or wayside. The module adds wireless connectivity to the system CPU. Main applications of the module include predictive maintenance, IoT gateway, diagnostics server, smart vehicle, passenger information and ticketing systems.",
        "Wireless Connectivity",
        " The ME1 comes with two M.2 slots for high-speed LTE modems (LTE Advanced or LTE). For each M.2 slot, two front-accessible micro-SIM card slots are available. The PCI Express Mini Card slot is prepared for an additional WLAN module. For GPS/GLONASS functions, the box has an onboard GNSS receiver and an SMA antenna connector.",
        "Modular System for Easy Configuration",
        " Within duagon's modular concept, the ME1 offers flexibility in built-to-order configurations. Via its extension connectors, the box can be easily combined with duagon CPU modules or other extension modules, for example a PSU or removable storage shuttles, providing additional features and short delivery times.",
        " In the modular system, data transfer between the modules as well as the power distribution between the individual components takes place via the duagon-standardized extension connectors.",
        "Flexible System Installation",
        " Various mounting options facilitate the integration of the box into an existing environment. The standard 35 mm DIN Rail mounting offers space-saving mounting of all system modules on a single rail. Wall mounting and mounting in a 19\" rack using adaption brackets are an option.",
        " The aluminum housing with cooling fins allows for fanless operation. The ME1 is maintenance free without moving parts.",
        "Rolling Stock Qualified and Long-Term Availability",
        " The wireless communication module is qualified for rolling stock and wayside applications as well as for industrial automation applications. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
