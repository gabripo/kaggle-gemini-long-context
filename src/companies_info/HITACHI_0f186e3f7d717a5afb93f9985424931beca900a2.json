        "Power transformers are the most important components of electrical energy supply networks. Although these components have high reliability, failures can occur due to external factors such as short circuits in the grid. Failures can also occur due to the aging effects of the active part, especially the insulation system, or the aging of important accessories such as bushings or on-load tap changers. In case of failure, the first action is to identify the type of failure. The aim is to localize the failure and its root cause.​\r\n​\r\nRepairing a transformer instead of replacing it can substantially reduce investment costs and provide a faster turnaround than buying a new transformer. Furthermore, to maximize the asset's technical life, a refurbishment or overhaul can be an intermediate action when no failure has occurred, and the aging of the active part has reached a stage where the continued reliability of the transformer is unacceptable.​",
        "Upgrade, repair, and extend services are frequently used options that can be performed either in an authorized service workshop or at the customer site. The reconditioned equipment undergoes complete testing and comes with a warranty.",
