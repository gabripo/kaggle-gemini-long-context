        "Hitachi Energy's IGBT power modules are available from 1700 to 6500 volt as single, dual / phase-leg, chopper IGBT and dual diode modules. The high-power HiPak IGBT modules feature low losses combined with soft-switching performance and record-breaking Safe Operating Area (SOA). The newly introduced 62Pak and LoPak fast switching medium-power IGBT modules feature lowest switching losses, full 175 °C operation with full square SOA and standard package allowing drop-in replacement.\r\nFor downloading and printing of data sheets in PDF format, click on the part numbers. ",
