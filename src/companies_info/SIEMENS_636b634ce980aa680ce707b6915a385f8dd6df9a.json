Those benefits are the key to success of improving your competitiveness and achieving maximum performance of your generator. We assist you with our unique services for generators, exciters and auxiliaries as well as with inspections and maintenance. Furthermore, with our digital service portfolio we can equip your plant with reliable on-line monitoring systems, predictive maintenance and digital data analysis for generators and high-voltage equipment. By choosing Siemens Energy generator services and solutions, you benefit from decades of experience and technical expertise.",
        "With over 150 years of experience, Siemens Energy is a world leader in generator technology and has manufactured many of the largest and most efficient generators in the world. ",
        "With Siemens Energy as your service partner, you can have the full benefits of the expertise of our turbine-generator factory personnel, design engineering, service engineering groups, and our regional management and service expertise. We are knowledgeable of potential turbine-generator issues through significant fleet experience and have developed an enormous backlog of field processes, procedures, tooling and trained personnel to quickly address them.",
        "In the current state of the energy market utility operators are in need of generators with resilience to meet the demands of generator operational flexibility.",
        "Siemens Energy generators have demonstrated a long service life, however the life of the generator is subject to normal aging processes which can manifest differently depending on the generator model and operational mode.",
        "In today’s operating grid demands, normal aging processes can be exacerbated and accelerated by changes in operating modes, with many startup and shutdowns, frequent turning gear operation in standby mode and fast load changes in the part load range, which can apply greater stress to the individual generator components.",
        "Complete replacement is in some cases the more cost-effective alternative. A detailed cost/benefit analysis can help you decide if and when an investment in a new generator is economically beneficial compared to maintenance and service expenditures for the current generator. Siemens Energy can provide a matching generator for almost all generator types and configurations.",
        "Specifically designed to replace smaller hydrogen- or water-cooled generator, the air-cooled Footprint™ generator is an easy to implement solution in which the existing foundations and interfaces can be used wherever possible.",
        "Detailed information about our Footprint™ concept",
        "When the power output of the turbine is increased, the generator capability needs to be adapted accordingly. Using specifically developed analysis measures, our Siemens Energy experts can quickly assess various options for uprating your generator and provide an individual proposal.",
        "Siemens Energy can offer the following measures for uprating your generator:",
        "The continuously growing renewables share as well as volatile grids can have a significant impact on the synchronous condenser power production equipment and also on the transmission system operation. The consequences can be multifaceted. Remaining fossil units may be highly cycled and the energy flow in the transmission system complex. At the same time, the stability of a converter dominated transmission system is challenging. The frequency and voltage control as well as fault ride through capability can require installation of new additional equipment for stable and safe grid operation.",
        "A synchronous condenser is a turbo generator without turbines, connected to the grid via unit transformer, that can be implemented by one of the following options:",
        "In power plants with several turbine generator sets, the implementation of an additional generator in synchronous condenser operation may represent the most cost-effective solution for increasing the plant output. The power factor in the existing generators is adjusted to produce more or even exclusive active power (MW). The missing reactive power fraction (MVAr) is to be compensated by the synchronous generator which is operated as a motor at zero load. The effort associated with the installation of an additional generator in the power plant architecture can be compensated for by the following advantages:",

        "With any modernization it is important to verify that all of the measures in the power plant are coordinated. Siemens Energy provides project management and can coordinate and harmonize the various scopes of supply and services. Additionally to generator modernizations, Siemens Energy is the right partner to provide comprehensive plant service solutions for high-voltage equipment, transformers, isolated phase bus ducts as well as excitation equipment (AVR).",
        "Your overall benefits can include:",
        "Currently there are more than 207 units installed with Generator Online Monitoring, and more than 500 additional sensor/measurement installation points.",
