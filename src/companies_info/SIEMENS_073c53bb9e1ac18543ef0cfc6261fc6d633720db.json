        "Siemens Energy HL-class gas turbines are paving the way to the next level of efficiency and performance.",
        "Derived from proven Siemens Energy H-class technology in an evolutionary development step, the next generation of Siemens Energy advanced air-cooled gas turbines uses a series of new, but already tested technologies like super-efficient internal cooling features for blades or vanes and an advanced combustion system to increase firing temperature. The result: A technology carrier to the next level with a combined cycle efficiency beyond 64% with a midterm goal of even higher efficiencies. The Siemens Energy HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz.",
        "The gas turbine is capable of world-class fast cold starts and hot re-starts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages and free thermal expansion of rotor and casing parts during transients. Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), an active clearance control,  ensures robustness and low turbine degradation at start-up. GT ramp-up rate 85 MW/min.",
        "The advanced can-annular combustion system with dual fuel capability allows for higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility. 25 premix burners improve the fuel/oxygen mixing. The ACE combustion system allows for GT turn-down to 30% minimum environmental load.",
        "All turbine blades and vanes are equipped with an innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating. This leads to higher combined cycle efficiency due to less cooling air consumption and reduced operational costs due to higher blade robustness.",
        "The HL-class has been designed to minimize outage times. Rotor de-stacking can easily be done on site thanks to the Hirth-serrated disc assembly. All rotating compressor and turbine blades can be replaced without rotor lift or rotor de-stacking. Turbine blade 1 and turbine blade 4 are removable without cover lift. With 33kEBH service intervals the service concept is very competitive.",
        "Due to proven and validated package and plant concepts the HL-class can easily be integrated in our power plants for simple cycle or combined cycle operation. This enables fast project execution. More than 50,0000  hours are saved on site due to modularized design and pre-engineered solutions.",
        "The new HL-class is based on the reliable engine architecture of the SGT-8000H series with design features that have proved reliability in operation for years: ",
        "Based on proven design and relying on the vast fleet experience of the SGT-8000H series, the new SGT5-9000HL combines the best of past experience with newly developed technologies. Thus, efficiency and performance are pushed to the next level.",
        "The HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. A modular design approach allows for a substantial number of common parts. The  HL-class is designed for high operational flexibility and has a joint DNA with the proven Siemens Energy H-class: Air-cooled 4-stage turbine, steel rotor / hirth serration / single tie bolt design, Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), can-annular combustion system",
        "Common parts minimize manufacturing risks and shorten lead times",
        "World-class fast cold starts and hot-restarts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages",
        "To achieve top performance and efficiency levels, the HL-class turbines are operating at highest combustion temperatures with an advanced combustion system.An innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating and super-efficient internal cooling features are protecting turbine blades and vanes while reducing the need of cooling air.Additionally, advanced 3D blading leads to higher aero efficiency in the compressor.  A free-standing, internally cooled turbine blade 4 reduces exhaust losses and allows for higher exhaust temperatures to enhance the water-steam cycle.",
        "for higher aero efficiency",
        "for higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility",
        "for better blade robustness and less cooling air consumption",
        "for higher power output",
        "Siemens Energy has re-invented the methodology for plant construction with a modular Power Core™.The Power Core™ consists of prefabricated Siemens Energy Solution Blocks and prefabricated pipe racks. These plug-and-play blocks are fabricated and tested in a controlled manufacturing environment and delivered to site as large modules which can be lifted into place for assembly. This results in increased safety on site, accelerated schedules, less dependence on the availability of skilled local labor and in the end lower project risk. HL-class power plants are based on one or more HL-class gas turbines and can achieve more than 64% efficiency in combind cycle operation:",

        " All components are designed with high focus on optimized LCOE, highest availability and serviceability. Several service features are supporting this. ",
        "Tremendous service fleet experience and continuous development result in a competitive service concept with 33,000 Equivalent Base Hours (EBH) / 1,250 Equivalent Starts (ES).",
        "for reduced down times",
        "through easy burner replacement thanks to innovative robot technology (picture: exemplary application – SGT5-8000H burner replacement)",
        "The SGT6-9000HL runs on natural gas, LNG, distillate oil, or other fuels. The engine is equipped with DLE burners and has the capability to burn up to 50 vol% of hydrogen (H₂).",
        "While reaching highest levels of performance and efficiency, the HL-class is still complying with NOx and CO regulations. NOx emissions: Down to 2 ppmvd (with SCR), or ≤25 ppmvd (without SCR).",
