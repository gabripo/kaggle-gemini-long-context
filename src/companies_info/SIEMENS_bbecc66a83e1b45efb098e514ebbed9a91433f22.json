        "High speed busbar transfer systems secure a fast and reliable change-over between the main and the back-up power supply sources when the availability of the auxiliary power supply is crucial.",
        "Our compact high speed busbar transfer system (HSBT-Compact) based on the SIPROTEC 6MD85 bay controller allows interruption-free or a short currentless gap transfer between two or three incoming feeders of medium voltage switchgears. This ensures a continuous power supply and safe functioning of auxiliaries in a power plant or an industrial plant.",
        " Flexible arrangement and marshalling of input and output signals  ",
        " Compact dimensions – can be directly installed in the switchgear  ",
        " Modular hardware and simple wiring design – no additional components necessary  ",
        " Semiconductor outputs for circuit breaker ON/ OFF commands  ",
        " Easy configuration and operation either via DIGSI 5 software or from the display  ",
        " Support of multiple communication protocols  ",
        "We appreciate your interest in our products. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to contact us!",
