        "A digital lifecycle approach for optimizing offshore Oil and Gas production",
        "With Topsides 4.0 we can help you answer any challenges you might experience, especially in a lower for longer oil price environment. Our engineered expertise is unrivaled in meeting the ever changing needs of EPCs and Owner Operators who are now rethinking how to manage the entire life-cycle of their assets. Siemens Energy has developed Topsides 4.0 - a comprehensive digital life-cycle approach designed to help offshore operators harness the full power of digital transformation for rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, and automation systems. This all starts with digitally configuring solutions jointly with our clients during the conceptual and design phases of their projects, progresses through manufacturing to virtual testing. All delivering an intelligent digital twin of the topsides facility for life cycle decision support and asset optimization. This effectively enables our clients to maximize the performance of critical equipment, and do end-to-end asset optimization.",
        "Topsides 4.0 is a digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems that begins during the conceptual and design phase of a project with the development of a comprehensive digital roadmap. It is during this time that we evaluate how the operator is using data, where the gaps are, and how to best fill them. With that knowledge, Siemens Energy collaborates with the operator and tailors a solution to meet their specific needs.",
        "Topsides 4.0 is designed to help offshore operators realize the full potential of Industry 4.0 and overcome the risks that are inherent in offshore projects by reducing capital and operating costs and shortening facility development cycles. This is achieved through digital project management and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent “Digital Twin” of the topsides facility, which can be used by operators for decision-making support and asset optimization.",
        "Digital solutions have long been applied in other industries to improve efficiency and productivity. The oil and gas industry, however, is just starting to begin its digital transformation. In offshore oil and gas production, many operators are beginning to discover the massive potential digitalization has to offer.",
        "The foundation of Topsides 4.0 is the workflow and data integration of solutions that Siemens Energy has successfully delivered to the oil and gas industry over many years. Although the integrated approach is new, the digital solutions that comprise it have a proven track record of success.",
        "Integral to the Topsides 4.0 approach is the creation of an intelligent digital twin, which is constructed in parallel to the physical topsides during the design and build phases of the project. The digital twin’s intelligence derives from the capability to interpret raw data through a variety of analytics, some of which are automated and others that are offered as an OEM service. The automated analytics are independent of an equipment vendor and based on statistical analysis of real-time data from the instrumentation and automation system.  For critical equipment, such as compressors and turbines, this layer of monitoring can be supplemented with OEM-connected services for predictive diagnostics, spare parts management, and outage planning.",
        "The digital twin is more than a design tool; it’s more than a punch list of parts to fabricate, and it’s more than the 3D model. It’s the joining of the physical and digital worlds as the asset moves through the three phases of a project: FEED and design, configure and build, operate and maintain. ",
        "COMOS Walkinside allows operators to create a series of real-life scenarios in which employees can literally see and experience the tasks they will be required to perform. They can virtually look around, listen, practice, and learn operational procedures at zero financial or physical risk to themselves or the operator. For example, maintenance personnel can view where equipment is located, if it is accessible from the floor, or if scaffolding or a crane is necessary, all in a 3D digital space. Using the link with the COMOS platform, they can directly access equipment characteristics, maintenance history, and documentation by clicking through on the equipment in the 3D view.",
        "The use of a single engineering data hub is a key enabler for digitalization and Topsides 4.0. With appropriate IT security measures, engineering and maintenance contractors, equipment and other providers can all share the as-built and as-maintained data image of the plant. Instead of delivering and attempting to maintain hard copy documentation, the different stakeholders deliver and update their MRB as data records, which simplifies and expedites the process substantially. This creates complete transparency of information for each plant object and ultimately optimizes the design process.",
        "The digital revolution has led to significant performance improvements for producers who are harnessing data-driven solutions; however, despite the largely positive developments, connecting critical equipment to cloud-based platforms does mean that the oil and gas industry must be prepared to respond to an evolving security landscape in which cyber threats are the norm. This is particularly critical when extending the operation of the platform to an onshore location, as is the case with Topsides 4.0.",
        "A key differentiator of Topsides 4.0 is that all electrical, instrumentation, control, and telecommunications (EICT) systems and equipment are integrated into one cybersecure solution. The EICT design establishes a resilient, reliable, and scalable system backbone and architecture to enable safe operation of the topsides facility from an onshore control center. ",
        "The SGT-750 delivers lowest total cost of ownership by reducing fuel costs, maintenance operations and outages. With best-in-class performance, a compact, lightweight design, and the lowest carbon footprint and emissions in the market, with single digit NOx over a wide load range.",
