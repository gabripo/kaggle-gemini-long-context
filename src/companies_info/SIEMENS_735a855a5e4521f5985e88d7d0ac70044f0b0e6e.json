        "With a proven, long-term track record of successful installations around the world, the SGT-800 gas turbine is an excellent choice for both industrial power generation and oil and gas applications.",
        "It will meet your requirements for efficiency, reliability and environmental compatibility, offering low lifecycle costs and the best possible return on investment. The SGT-800 will support your combined cycle and cogeneration installations with its excellent efficiency and outstanding steam-raising capability. Designed for flexible operation, it is perfectly suited for base and intermediate load as well as grid support.",
        "Whatever the application, the SGT-800 meets your requirements for efficiency, reliability and environmental compatibility. As a result, you can expect lowest lifecycle cost of operation and the best possible return on investment.",
        "The combustor and burner designs offer world-class emission performance over a wide load range with single-digit CO emission levels and capable of down to 9 ppm NOx emissions. Low emissions are also achieved with liquid fuel without the need of water injection. Designed to reduce environmental impact, the SGT-800 gas turbine will help you meet even the strictest emission regulations worldwide.",
        "Reliability has been a top priority from day one of the development of the SGT-800. Thanks to simple and robust technical solutions the reported average fleet reliability of the core engine and auxiliary systems lies at a world-class 99.1% for year 2024.",
        "The SGT-800 offers broad flexibility in fuels, operating conditions, maintenance concepts, package solutions and ratings. These flexible solutions have been developed in order to satisfy your individual market-specific requirements.",
        "The SGT-800 features a compact, modular, maintenance-friendly design. This maintainability combined with the turbine’s robust single-shaft arrangement, long time between overhauls and long lifetime ensures its high operational availability. Flexible service concepts for on-site or off-site maintenance with possibility for 48-hour core engine exchange will maximize the availability even further.",
        "With its high electrical efficiency the SGT-800 is the core of your power plant installation – from simple cycle to combined cycle operation, with single or multiple units.  Its excellent steam generation capability also makes the SGT-800 an ideal choice in combined heat and power (CHP) installations.",
        "As we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volatile nature of solar and wind. A key option is to replace conventional natural gas and diesel fuels with green biofuels in gas turbines.",
        "The SGT-800 industrial gas turbine blends a robust, simple design for reliability and easy maintenance with high efficiency and low emissions. Its continuous evolution, based on fleet experience and proven design solutions, guarantees optimal performance and a long operational lifetime for your gas turbine.",
        "The single-shaft engine is composed of a 2-bearing rotor with a 15-stage compressor and a 3-stage turbine.",
        "Two different package solutions are available for increased flexibility in order to meet your individual requirements. Both are available for 50 Hz and 60 Hz markets.",
        "Standard options for hot and cold climates are available for operation at extreme ambient temperatures.",
        "Flexibility and efficiency are key for your power plant solutions. The excellent efficiency and steam-raising capability of the SGT-800 gas turbine make it outstanding in cogeneration – also called combined heat and power (CHP) –  and combined cycle installations.",
        "We offer you a broad range of power plant configurations based on one or multiple SGT-800 gas turbines. Within our standard plant configuration we can offer a high degree of scope flexibility. This enables plant optimization to suit your specific requirements, such as island-mode operation or multiple power blocks.",
        "Whatever your application requirements, our flexible scope will fit your needs. We can offer a range of plant equipment – from gas turbine and steam turbine only, to full turnkey plant:",
        "Our SGT-800-based power plants offer the flexibility required in today's volatile energy landscape: quick starts, fast load following and low emissions on low plant part-load operation. Designed for frequent starts and stops, they are the perfect match to back up renewable power sources in the grid.",
        "One or multiple SGT-800 gas turbines provide the core of a powerful combined cycle plant: In a 2x1 combined cycle configuration, the power output is up to 180 MW(e) at a net plant efficiency of more than 60%. In a combined heat and power (CHP) cycle, the efficiency is more than 92% with supplementary firing.",
        "Our comprehensive service portfolio ensures low life cycle costs and optimal performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle, including: ",
        "Whatever you need: The SGT-800 offers gas only, liquid only (Diesel No.2) or dual fuel (gas/liquid) with on-load fuel-changeover capability. The excellent fuel flexibility allows e.g. for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons in the gas fuel composition without any maintenance impact. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 75 vol% of hydrogen (H2).",
        "The low gas supply pressure requirement (27–31 bar[a] / 390–450 psi[a]) reduces the need for a gas compressor on site.",
        "All SGT-800 units are equipped with a robust dual-fuel Dry Low Emission (DLE) combustion system to minimize NOₓ and CO emissions. The combustor and burner designs offer world-class emission performance over a wide load range with single-digit CO emission levels and capable of down to 9 ppm NOx emissions. With this gas turbine you will comply with both global and regional regulations.",
        "TÜV SÜD has developed a guideline for defining the “H2-Readiness” of power plants and is offering an independent certification to original equipment manufacturers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. The certification increases investment security for utilities. Siemens Energy is the first company worldwide to receive this certification for its “H2-Ready” power plant concept for the SGT-800. The guideline for obtaining certification was developed in collaboration with subject matter experts from Siemens Energy.",
