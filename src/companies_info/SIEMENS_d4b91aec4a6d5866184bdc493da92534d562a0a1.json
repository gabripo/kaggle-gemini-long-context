        "Siemens Energy recommends a plant-specific feasibility study to guide sites towards understanding current capabilities, realistic target setting, hydrogen design package development and establishing a milestone execution plan. The resulting plan will leverage existing technologies and infrastructure to the extent possible to develop and design a package specific to the facility and aligned with the organization’s decarbonization goals.",
        "When existing gas turbine plants are made ready for hydrogen co-firing, the facility can be extended to produce and store its own hydrogen using Siemens Energy Elyzers.",
        "The below example shows an operational SCC-4000F power plant incrementally moving from 100% methane operation to 100% hydrogen using Elyzer P-300 electrolyzers with storage as shown in the images above.",
        "By transforming the conventional power plant into a hydrogen energy plant, the facility is able to leverage cheap renewable energy from the grid and turning that into hydrogen for use when the gas turbine facility is being called upon. This feature brings immediate CO2 emissions reduction, it saves money on CO2 taxation and provides an energy storage capability with potential gains from storage credits. ",

        "The heat pump captures waste heat from the electrolysis process and increases its temperature to feed either directly into a district heating network, or temporarily store it in a thermal energy storage system as a buffer before feeding it into the heat network.",
