        "Decarbonizing the energy industry is about more than switching to renewable sources. To achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP), it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating F-gases from electrical switchgear – particularly SF6, a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2.",
        "Our Blue portfolio uses clean air and vacuum switching technology instead. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment.",
        "Less global warming potential is not good enough. It has to be Zero, because 1% global warming potential is still global warming potential. It has to be Zero and it has to be now.",
        "Nikola Jankulovski",
        "Siemens Energy Project Lead",
        "We’ve recently invested €60 million in our Berlin facility to step up production of vacuum interrupters for our Blue portfolio. This will help to secure our supply chain – and since the plant uses 100% renewable energy, it will also increase our sustainability.",
        "Our Blue products use vacuum switching technology and clean air insulation to produce Zero harmful emissions - and without having to compromise on performance or economic feasibility. With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster.",
        "It's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible.",
        "Our clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances.",
        "No single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces.",
        "Our new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines.",
        "At Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage.",
        "This collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly.",
        "Our Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action.",
        "We delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy.",
        "\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy.",
        "Thanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution.",
        "\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett.",
        "This high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity.",
        "\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development.",
        "When we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air.",
        "\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid.",
        "The digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance.",
        "\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH.",
