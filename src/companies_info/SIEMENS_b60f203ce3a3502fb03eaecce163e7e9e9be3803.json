        "In combined cycle power plants (CCPP) a gas turbine generator generates electricity while the waste heat from the gas turbine is used to produce steam to generate additional electricity via a steam turbine. Siemens has a wide portfolio of cost competitive, high performance, operationally flexible and easily constructable steam turbines to meet the diverse needs of customers. The exhaust heat of the gas turbine is utilized to generate steam by passing it through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), so it can be used to drive the steam turbine. This combination of two power generation cycles enhances the efficiency of the plant. Combined cycle power plants equipped with the latest Siemens technology achieve unprecedented efficiency levels of more than 60 percent. The high fuel utilization factor of the plant contributes to low lifecycle costs.",
