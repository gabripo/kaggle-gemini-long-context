        "Low Power CPU for IoT/Network Applications",
        " The MC50I is a modular computer for embedded applications in industrial automation. The computing platform features an Intel Atom E3900 series CPU with low power dissipation and scalability in performance and memory.",
        " The MC50I is the ideal basis for functions such as security gateway, predictive maintenance or CCTV, or to act as a diagnostics server.",
        "Modular System for Easy Configuration",
        " The MC50I can be a stand-alone product, but due to the modular concept it offers flexible built-to-order configurations. The box can be easily combined with prefabricated extension modules, providing additional features and short delivery times.",
        " In the modular system, the data transfer between the modules as well as the power distribution between the individual modules takes place via the extension connectors standardized by duagon.",
        " Extension modules can provide application-specific functions like wireless communication (LTE advanced, WLAN, GNSS), CAN bus, or other I/O. A removable storage shuttle can support the integration of a 2.5\" SATA HDD/SSD.",
        "Power Saving Design and Security Features",
        " The board management controller provides enhanced reliability and reduced downtime. The Trusted Platform Module supports security and encryption features. With the ignition switch for remote control of booting and shutdown, the platform provides additional features for power saving.",
        "Flexible System Installation",
        " Various mounting options facilitate the integration of the box into an existing environment. The standard 35 mm DIN Rail mounting offers space saving mounting of all system modules on a single rail. Wall mounting and mounting in a 19\" rack using adaption brackets are an option.",
        " The aluminum housing with cooling fins allows fanless operation. MC50I has no moving parts, making it maintenance free.",
        "Wayside Qualified and Long-Term Availability",
        " The CPU module is qualified for wayside and information technology applications. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
