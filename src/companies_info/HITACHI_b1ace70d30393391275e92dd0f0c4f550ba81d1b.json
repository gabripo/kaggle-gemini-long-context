        "TXpert™ Hub is the heart of Hitachi Energy’s TXpert™ Ecosystem. It enables you to take simple steps to digitalize your transformer; liquid-filled or dry; new or retrofitted; regardless of its brand.",
        "TXpert™ Hub collects data from sensors, watches interdependencies, and trends their evolution based on configurable thresholds. It acts as the secure firewall for communication going up from or down to the transformer, allowing safe remote monitoring.",
        "The open, scalable, and manufacturer-agnostic TXpert™ Hub grants flexibility to integrate and qualify third-party devices as TXpert™ Ready Sensors, collecting data seamlessly from other new and existing equipment.",
        "TXpert™ Hub’s simple pre-packaged offering is modular and scalable, allowing the users to start small and expand with time or with changing conditions of the asset. It also unlocks entry to a complete ecosystem of software, services, and solutions which enables Hitachi Energy to customize its offerings and services to your needs.",
        "TXpert™ Hub is built with cybersecurity at its core. It is industry-leading, with 3rd party certification and continuous monitoring of threats. It is certified IEC 62443-4-2, conforms to IEEE1686, and enables conformity to NERC-CIP standards. Thanks to an IEC 62443-4-1 and ISO27001 certified development team.",
        "Watch the video on LinkedIn",
        "The prepackaged offering of TXpert™ Hub allows us to answer most customer needs, but it can also be engineered to fit your specific requirements. All options are offered for new or retrofit applications. However, some limitations might exist due to the transformer design.",
        "The topology of the Distribution grid is evolving and becoming much more complex. Real-time information is increasingly fundamental for efficient operation. TXpert™ enabled digital distribution transformers are ideally suited for this - enabling the integration of renewables, industry, and infrastructure applications.",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub Dry Basic allows temperature monitoring of up to three windings and cooling control based on configurable thresholds. This helps extend the lifetime of a transformer by cooling the windings to avoid insulation degradation.",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub Dry Basic + allows, additionally, to calculate hotspots and aging of the transformers. As well as meter-grade power quality measurements like harmonics, power factor, or current and voltage imbalance. These greater analytics allow the user to understand the impact of external factors like renewables, electric charging stations, or increased demand on the transformer and the grid.",
        "The combination of climate change, increasing energy demand, and the need for energy security and equity means that the power system urgently needs to grow in scale and strength and evolve toward a fossil-free energy future.",
        "Digitalizing distribution transformers is the only way to manage this complexity and deliver the necessary visibility, agility, and fast, data-driven decision-making. The TXpert™-enabled distribution transformers can support managing power quality and flow control and enabling efficient and safe electricity networks that are fit for the needs of today and tomorrow.",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub Distribution Transformers Basic allows temperature monitoring of hotspots and aging based on configurable thresholds. This helps understand the effect of climate change and grid evolution on the transformer's life.",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub Distribution Transformers Basic + allows additionally to catch fast-forming faults with hydrogen and moisture trending. As well as meter-grade power quality measurements like harmonics, power factor, or current and voltage imbalance. This larger set of analytics allows the user to understand the impact of external factors like renewables, electric charging stations, or increased demand on the transformer and the grid.",
        "TXpert™ lets you start making simple steps in your journey to digitalizing your transformers, taking control of complexity, and achieving leaps in performance. Either at the heart of the digital substation or as a stand-alone unit, TXpert™ Enabled power transformers provide benefits such as insightful operational data to make informed business decisions: optimizing operations, reducing outages, facilitating condition-based maintenance, or delaying a replacement.\n",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub PT Basic supports reducing insulation aging by monitoring temperatures, hotspots, and aging based on configurable thresholds. It also enables increased load capacity by forecasting the effects of short-term overloading and controlling the cooling system to optimize the impact on transformer life. TXpert™ Hub can as well integrate existing sensors or relays on the transformer, creating a single secure remote connection to the outside.",
        "Our TXpert™ Hub PT Basic + avoids unplanned outages by catching fast-forming faults with hydrogen and moisture trending. As well as bushing capacitance and dielectric dissipation factors to monitor the degradation of the insulation of the bushing.",
        "\r\nOur TXpert™ Hub PT Advanced can delay the replacement of a sick transformer by collecting the most complete set of data with additional full dissolved gas analytics, tap changer operations, and contact wear.",
