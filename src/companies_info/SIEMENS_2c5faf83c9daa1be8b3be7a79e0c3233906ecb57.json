        "The ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) is driving the rapid pace of digital adoption across multiple industries. The oil and gas industry is beginning a transformation of its own, increasingly looking toward data-driven solutions to boost performance, enhance efficiency and ultimately, to reduce costs. Siemens Energy helps customers optimize the performance of critical oil and gas assets and equipment. We draw on an extensive software portfolio, deep expertise in data analytics and extensive experience in oil and gas and other industries.  ",
        "Digitalization and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand when it comes to protecting assets against cyberattacks. ",
        "Digital technologies are helping almost every industry rewrite its operating landscape, and the oil and gas industry is catching up. Advancements in technology, the falling cost of digitalization, and the connectivity of smart devices provide a real competition-beating opportunity for oil and gas companies who play the digital revolution right. The potential benefits of going digital are increased productivity, shorter response and intervention times, cost savings, safer operations, and asset integrity as well as sustainable resource treatment. By utilizing our highly engineered Artificial Lift technologies like AI4ESP or SIWELL, we are able to efficiently optimize automation for well pumps.",
        "Think offshore production can be profitable in a cyclical oil and gas market? Aker BP does. And so does Siemens Energy. ",
        "In fact, Aker BP's bold publically stated objective is to drive production costs to US$7 per barrel. On the Ivar Aasen Field Development project Siemens worked closely with Aker BP to implement condition monitoring—a data-driven approach to optimizing equipment maintenance schedules, and ultimately, to reducing costs. \n",
        "Instead of monitoring critical equipment from a North Sea platform, Aker BP personnel monitor it from an onshore control room in Trondheim, Norway, 1,000 km away. A unique process known as time-stamping, as opposed to the more conventional sampling, enhances the accuracy of the acquired machine data, better positioning crews to predict and preempt any maintenance issues.",
        "The net result? Fewer personnel working on the remote offshore platform for extended periods, not to mention traveling to and from the jobsite via helicopter, and a significant OPEX savings.",
        "Data-driven remote condition monitoring optimizes offshore maintenance, reduces costs ",
        "As the world’s oil and gas industry strives to expand margins by reducing production costs wherever possible, advanced capabilities enabled by the integration and digitalization of upstream operations can help in substantial ways. One prime example is remote condition monitoring of well-site equipment, especially offshore.",
        "Aker BP deployed remote condition monitoring on its offshore platform, built to develop Ivar Aasen field in the Norwegian North Sea, in an effort to reduce OPEX costs, increase regularity and improve operations safety.",
        "This technical paper presents Siemens Energy's view on key cybersecurity defensive mechanisms based on the pipeline control and communications systems defense-in-depth approach, focusing on Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) protection measures, sequence of event (SOE) clock synchronization, multi-factor authentication, early-warning cyber intrusion detection and ransomware recovery. Originally published in Pipeline Technology Journal, April 2020.",
