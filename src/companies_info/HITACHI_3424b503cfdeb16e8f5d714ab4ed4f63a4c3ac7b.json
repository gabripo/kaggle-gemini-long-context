        "HVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations.",
        "HVDC Light® increases the reliability of Hitachi Energy, and the technology extends the economical power range of HVDC transmission down to just a few tens of Megawatts (MW). In the upper range, the technology now reaches 3,000 MW and ±640 kV - enough electricity to power several million households and enable power transmission over 2,000 kilometers. The system design enables compact converter stations – a big benefit in applications like offshore wind and interconnections.",
        "HVDC Light® is quick to install and provides an alternative to conventional AC transmission systems and local generation in several cases, such as:\n",
        "Utilities are under extreme pressure to meet consumer and regulatory demands for a high-quality, competitively priced power supply that has a low environmental impact. The expansion of AC transmission capacity is often limited by local planning regulations and the concerns of local residents who object to the installation of new overhead lines. ",
        "HVDC VSC technology from Hitachi Energy helps to expand transmission capacity, minimizes environmental impact and also improves the quality of the power supply.\r\n ",
        "HVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used.",
        "Electricity is converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa in a converter station. This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves.",
        "Hitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world.",
        "The control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.",
        "IdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time.",
