Through our Collaborative Operations Centers and service-level agreements, Hitachi Energy can help to proactively address these issues before they challenge your system reliability.",
        "You’ll find Hitachi Energy COCs in Malaysia, Australia, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, and Italy. They work in harmony with engineering and service centers located in more than 40 countries to ensure that you have expertise available to meet unexpected problems.\n",

        "You also can opt for a specific EnCompass™ agreement to have services such as security or firmware updates delivered over a secure remote platform. Our team will work with you to identify the most effective course of action for your requirements. Then, you can tailor your Hitachi Energy Grid Automation EnCompass agreement to meet your needs.\n",
        "A service-level agreement with Hitachi Energy Grid Automation Service ensures constant care of your assets and helps you hit your key performance targets. You can focus on your business while Hitachi Energy’s team handles software, hardware, compatibility, and security.\n",
