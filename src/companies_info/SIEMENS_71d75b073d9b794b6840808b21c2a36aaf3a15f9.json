        "A conversation with Jonathan Tubb from Siemens Energy and Marty Edwards from Tenable on breaking down current trends in industrial cybersecurity and how to overcome them. We discussed the topics of; 2023 cybersecurity in review, insurance policies and trends, movement to proactive security vs. reactive security, the importance of cybersecurity for power generation, and roles and responsibilities.",
        "Siemens Energy and Tenable are expanding our cooperation to secure critical energy infrastructure. Among other things, this means our proven Omnivise T3000 control system security protection will be enhanced with Tenable OT Security at the core.",
        "Siemens Energy and National Academic and Non-profit Partners announced a new Cybersecurity & Industrial Infrastructure Security Apprenticeship Program (CIISAp).",
        "Blog: Building the Next Generation of Industrial Cyber Defenders",
        "Eos.ii™ is the first AI-based monitoring and detection platform that can serve as the foundation for securing industrial IoT in an era of persistent cyberattacks",
        "Here's why:",
        "Energy companies increasingly recognize that their likelihood of being attacked is nearly 100% and that they must strengthen their agility and resiliency so they can respond when - not if - they are attacked.",
        "Governments are responding to the growing cyber threat by rolling out comprehensive critical infrastructure regulations. But there is a difference between being compliant and being secure.",
        "Increased connectivity, automation, and data-driven operations makes a strong cybersecurity program essential.",
        "Siemens Energy, Saudi Aramco and the World Economic Forum launched a cybersecurity playbook for the oil and gas industry. The report, “Cyber Resilience in the Oil and Gas Industry Playbook”, establishes a blueprint for boards and business leaders to evaluate cyber risk and enhance cyber resilience across the industry.",
        "Eos.ii™ empowers CISOs and SOCs with the platform and insights needed to scale up security to meet the demands of IoT business models. It offers unmatched capabilities to help energy and critical infrastructure organizations build and maintain robust, adaptable, and resilient defenses in a fast-moving and competitive IoT future.",
        "Managed Detection and Response (MDR) powered by Eos.ii™ is an AI-based service, powered by Siemens Energy’s revolutionary monitoring platform. It provides energy companies with the visibility and context to shine a light into industrial operating environment to stop attacks before they occur.",
        "This white paper offers an example of an attack against a fictional electric utility, as it manages an unfolding crisis and illustrates how incident response planning can make a difference in reaching the least disruptive outcome.",
        "Wind farm developers, owners, and operators share an interest in cybersecurity risk manage ment strategies that account for the full life cycle of these assets. To ensure secure reliable renewable power delivery, offshore wind farms should be built and operated with a secure by design approach, with systems-level integration in mind, and with the understanding that the threat environment will continue to evolve long after construction is complete. ",
        "This MIT Technology Review report gathers insights from leading practitioners in the oil and gas sector to better understand how global companies are applying advanced digital technologies to both improve efficiency and protect themselves from cyberattacks — and why AI is the key to unlocking and securing the energy transition.",
        "This report from the Ponemon Institute highlights the unique cybersecurity requirements for  for the Utility industry.",
        "In conjunction with the Ponemon Institute, this report delves into the cyber readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East.",
        "Learn how US companies in the oil and gas industry are addressing cybersecurity risks in the operational technology (OT) environment.",
        "Our offering:\r\nGap analysis",
        "What you will get:\r\nFindings report that includes both a critical gap summary and a roadmap for recommended remediation",
        "Our offering:\r\nIncident response planning and testing",
        "What you will get:\r\nDetailed plan on how to respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including emergency procedures, roles, and resources",
        "Our offering:\r\nFirewall assessment and patch management",
        "What you will get:\r\nFindings and recommendations for heightened security; malware pattern updates and management",
        "Our offering:\r\nSecurity event monitoring system",
        "What you will get:\r\nReal-time monitoring by collecting and parsing security logs",
        "Our broad portfolio combines leading industry technologies and tools with expert know-how",
        "Siemens Energy, along with its technology partner Darktrace, brings real-time anomaly detection to the industrial OT environment. Siemens Energy Plant Security Monitoring service provides the continuous visibility required to make smarter, faster decisions.",
        "The Siemens Energy Vulnerability Management solution provides a non-intrusive way to discover, visualize, and monitor sensitive systems continuously. We provide technical support for designing, deploying, and enabling Tenable's unique software on the control system network to provide a complete picture across the network.",
        "Plant managers often lack an up-to-date, comprehensive asset inventory of all connected assets. Siemens Energy, in conjunction with PAS™, helps our customers meet this challenge with automated Cyber Asset Management. This includes configuration change management and advice on potential cybersecurity threats.",
        "Many energy companies keep their networks unconnected because they believe this makes them cyber secure. This misguided strategy will fall victim to more successful attacks, from inside and outside. Connectivity gives you visibility which provides insight.",
        "Many companies do not know what assets and devices exist on their OT networks.",
        "This limits their understanding of where their infrastructure is most vulnerable.",
        "Most energy companies have focused on building up their IT cyber capabilities. But these cannot be simply deployed into the OT environment because of differences in the systems, data, devices, and critical dependencies. Because of this inattention to OT, cybersecurity experts who can secure complex, aging, and interdependent infra-structure are hard to find.",
        "OT systems are older than IT systems. OT equipment, which can last decades, is often developed with proprietary systems that have exposures and vulnerabilities difficult to protect.",
        "Even if a company detects a potential intrusion into its OT cybersecurity environment, it may lack the plans or capabilities to respond effectively.",
        "Cyber solutions must apply across multiple vendors to provide a single, seamless cyber program.",
        "If you say “yes” to one or more of the questions above, you are not alone. For energy companies, the probability of a cyber attack is nearly 100%.  ",
        "Overcoming the fear of connectivity is essential because the benefits of digitalization are too great. Organizations must focus on agility and resiliency so they can respond when – not if – they are attacked.",
        "We combine our deep OT know-how with cutting-edge technology from selected partners to provide end-to-end solutions for every step in our customers' cybersecurity journey.",
