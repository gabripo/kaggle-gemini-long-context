        "The LIFE OCEAN project is the first project which aims to use a carbon-neutral fuel for electric energy production on a Sanlorenzo superyacht",
        "The maritime sector represents about 13.5% the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at EU level (Source: EEA, 2021). In order to foster decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector, the IMO fixed a target of 80% cut of GHG emissions until 2050 and cut of 100% until 2100. The path towards decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector will also lead to the reduction and/or abatement of pollutants like CO, NOX, SOX, PM, BC, HC that are emitted by fossil fuels combustion. The installation of a methanol reformer coupled to a HTPEM fuel cell could represent an interesting solution as auxiliary power unit of yachts and superyachts, to cover the hotel load but also to sustain slow speed cruising and maneuvering operations in ports.",
        "Aim of the LIFE OCEAN (onboard clean energy and no-noise) project is to substitute the traditional diesel generators used to cover the hotel loads of a Sanlorenzo superyacht with a methanol-based fuel cell system. Along with air pollution mitigation, on board noise will be abated while underwater noise will be reduced thanks to the elimination of diesel generators. The solution adopted constitutes a zero-carbon technology for the maritime sector, adopting green methanol whose large capacity production is growing at both EU and extra-EU level.",
        "Instead of methanol the project will foster the adoption of green methanol (methanol produced by renewable sources, i.e. from agricultural and forestry residues, biogas, organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, synthesis of H2 produced from electrolytic processes and CO2 coming from carbon capture technologies).",
        "Furthermore, methanol is easy to store and handle, it is biodegradable and does not contain sulphur. It is liquid at environmental temperature and pressure, it presents a good energy density (around 22 MJ/kg) and does not need cryogenic tanks for its storage like LNG. ",
        "1. Step\nFirst, the sustainable produced methanol needs to be mixed with water to enable the electrochemical reaction in the reformer. To safe space, weight and hence energy on the vessel it is our goal to find a solution to reuse the water produced in the fuel cell instead of installing a water tank. Resulting in an onboard water cycle and savings of this valuable resource.\n",

        "This produces electrical energy, which is used in this project to supply electricity to a superyacht.",
        "Reduction in primary energy use ",
        "for the typical use profile of only one yacht per year",
        "Reduction in use of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances",
        "Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ",
        "We are establishing an important milestone in decarbonising the maritime industry, paving the way for the widespread adoption of this technology across other types of vessels. Our fuel cell system will reduce air pollution and significantly decrease both onboard and underwater noise, as unlike diesel generators, there are no moving parts that create noise or vibrations. The solution constitutes a carbon neutral technology for the maritime sector.",
