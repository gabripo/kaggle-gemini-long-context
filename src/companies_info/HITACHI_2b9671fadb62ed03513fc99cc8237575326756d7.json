Regular preventive maintenance helps facilitate forward budget planning. Using us as your supplier ensures access to true transformer and transformer component expertise paired with the capability to capture and address potential issues at an early stage.",
        "To extend the life of your assets, Hitachi Energy provides preventive (eventually curative) actions to be performed on-site, aiming to maintain the performance of the transformer for which specific equipment and a higher degree of expertise are required. It is usually linked with diagnostic tests and possible engineering studies to clearly determine the most appropriate route of action and ensure condition-based maintenance.",
