        "The SA3 is a 1-channel RS232 interface adapter with optical isolation.",
        " SA-Adapters are small universal boards providing the physics for legacy serial I/O, fieldbus interfaces and other small I/O functions. One serial line is provided per adapter, which can be plugged directly to the CPU board as a mezzanine. Alternatively, the adapter can be connected to the front panel via ribbon cable. The SA concept allows to add additional I/O interfaces to many of duagon's CPU boards, enhancing flexibility with regardto the line transceivers and isolation requirements. Whether a specific SA-Adapter (or a mix of different SA-Adapters) fits on a specific CPU board is determined by a combination of mechanical, performance, FPGA and operating system criteria and needs tobe verified for every board configuration requested.",
