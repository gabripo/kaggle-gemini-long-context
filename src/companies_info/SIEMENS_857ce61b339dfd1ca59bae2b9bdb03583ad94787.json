        "Highest availability without compromising safety",
        "Siemens Energy offers condition monitoring solutions, machinery protection solutions and machinery diagnostic services as well as other related services. They consist of hardware components and software tools for data analytics relying on sensors. Continuous condition monitoring is the corner stone of transparency on the functioning of processes and aggregates. It is also called anomaly detection and does not only reveal deviations from normal behavior, but also indicates what is happening, when and where.",
        "Siemens Energy machinery protection solutions allow insights into asset’s health. The solutions protect, forecast and increase the asset availability. They provide hydro power plants with the capability to deliver electricity rapidly when it is needed, store excess power and reestablish energization to grid. VIB3000 & CM500 support reliable power generation for hydro power plants.",
        "VIB3000 hardware platform and the CM500 Vibroexpert software has become property of Siemens Energy AG. Find contact information for ordering new VIB3000 racks, spare parts and CM500 Vibroexpert software.",
        "VIB3000 Machinery Protection was designed to provide maximum safety and highest availability for the protected assets. State-of-the-art measurement and signal processing technology, along with built-in redundancy options for fail-safe operation warrant the desired level of confidence in the system. Learn more in this whitepaper.",
        "Siemens Energy’s Diagnostic Services team built up decades of hands-on vibration analysis experience, backed by Siemens Energy’s rotor dynamic experts and by a wealth of first-hand experience from building steam and gas turbines and generators. Their reports and recommendations support our customers in planning corrective actions and cutting operating costs.",
        "The Machinery Protection System VIB3000 supports individual redundancy philosophies by offering redundancy at all levels, sensor connections, signal processing, voting and DCS uplinks.",
        "Depending on the desired solution, VIB3000’s firmware, Profibus communication, output relays and output analogs can be SIL-1 certified. Another option is a non-SIL version with extended connectivity. The machinery protection system can be integrated into the Siemens Energy I&C and supports configuration from the plant DCS. PROFIBUS and MODBUS interfaces are available and can replace 0/4…20mA interfaces. The technology implemented into Machinery Protection also features digitalization throughout the system, “voting” within the system (on-board-voting) and short response time.",
        "The main objective of the Siemens Energy VIB3000 Machinery Protection system is to fulfill safety and availability targets without compromise by protecting the machine and the environment from the consequences of machine failure.",

        "CM500 Condition Monitoring (also known as Vibroexpert CM500) is the solution for condition monitoring and machinery analysis as well as machinery diagnostics of rotating equipment of in power plants.   ",
        "Vibration monitoring and detection of abnormal machine behavior at the earliest possible point in time enables cost-effective maintenance-planning. By sensitive diagnostic condition monitoring, CM500 Condition Monitoring provides information on possible mechanical causes of abnormal behavior (unbalance, bearing damage, incorrect alignment, cracks and loose parts). The solution includes all tools used for machinery analysis and diagnostics and thus for determining the causes of asset health issues.",
        "Depending on the actual process situation, CM500 monitors vibration characteristic parameters by comparing current vibration indicators with up to 64 different sets of reference values and limits.",
        "This kind of precision allows CM500 to detect anomalies at the earliest.",
        "To consistently implement condition-based maintenance strategies, in-depth knowledge of the power plant assets’ condition is required. CM500 Condition Monitoring offers vibration analysis for any kind of turbines (Siemens Energy or other manufacturers), any kind of fan (induced-draft, forced-draft), any kind of pump (feed water, condensate, cooling water), compressors, hydro-generators, gearboxes, electric motors, conveyor drives, etc. as well as for any kind of DCS (Siemens Energy or third-party).",

        "Based on the vibration analysis the Siemens Energy Diagnostic Services team combines in-depth analytics with years of domain expertise to provide you with most reliable information on the health condition of your assets. Regular status and event-based reports indicate what is happening when and where. Detailed reports with recommendations from experienced Siemens Energy diagnostic experts support you in planning corrective actions and thus cutting operating costs.",
