        "With energy transition, good power quality is becoming more and more essential for utility, industrial and commercial networks. Growing renewables and dominance of electronics in industrial and consumer segments makes the grid more prone and more sensitive to disruptions like harmonics, voltage variations, load imbalance and poor power factor. These disruptions can result into poor productivity, damage to equipment, financial losses and penalties from utility for non-compliance to grid code.",
