        "Hitachi Energy's CoreSenseTM M10 provides real-time, continuous, online monitoring of dissolved gas and moisture levels in transformer oil. The CoreSenseTM M10 is qualified as TXpertTM Ready Sensors to connect with CoreTecTM 4, the TXpertTM Hub, which accurately measures the following nine gases in transformer mineral oils, ester, and silicon fluids.",
        "Dissolved gas readings are used to provide early identification and warnings for most transformer faults, whereas moisture monitoring can prevent premature aging of a unit. Early identification and detection of such incipient faults thereby allow you to take preemptive measures when needed and avoid expensive outages.",
        "Hitachi Energy's CoreSenseTM M10 minimizes the risks of oil leaks and simplifies the installation by using a single flange and limiting oil circulation to the sample head.",
        "Hitachi Energy's CoreSenseTM M10 is designed for operation with no consumables. Thanks to its field-proven Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and industrial-grade design, the CoreSenseTM M10 will not drift over time and does not require any carrier or calibration gases. It reduces the risks of oil leaks with a simple pump-less oil circuit limited to the measuring head and uses built-in redundancies for reliable, maintenance-free operation.",
        "Hitachi Energy's CoreSenseTM M10 can survive in harsh outdoor conditions with temperature extremes from -50°C to +55°C and corrosive conditions and can operate under one meter (3 feet) of water.",
        "Hitachi Energy's CoreSense M10 can be used with transformers filled with the following fluids:",
