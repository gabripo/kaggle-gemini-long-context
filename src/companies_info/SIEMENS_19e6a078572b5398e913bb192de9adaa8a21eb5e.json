        "Make an investment in your independence – and ensure a reliable and flexible power supply for your processes. Electricity and heating are major cost factors for industrial plants. That means there’s a long-term cost benefit in having your own power plant at your factory, mining, or production facility. It also helps you achieve climate goals and stay ahead of the competition. We will create just the right power plant solution for your purposes.",
        "Global megatrends and the energy transformation redefine the requirements for competitiveness in all energy-intensive industries. Reliable, economical and environmentally compatible supplies of power, steam, heating and cooling play an increasingly important role. Get ready for the future with us: Concentrate on your core business, while we help you manage your energy supply.",
        "Every industry, every factory, and every facility has its own unique demands for power supply. That’s why we configure and optimize your system individually, from the initial design to the final component. It goes without saying that we incorporate technologies proven in hundreds of facilities and over thousands of operating hours. Another factor that cuts your project risk: We pre-manufacture entire modules and test them away from the construction site. This means much less expense incurred on-site at your facility.",
        "Siemens Energy has a thorough understanding of the processes in your industry. After all, we’ve been building, expanding, and modernizing all kinds of industrial facilities for decades. We know that production processes have to be closely interlinked with ancillary activities like electricity and heat generation and energy distribution. Only once everything is integrated can the opportunities for automation and digitalization be exploited to the full.",
        "Processing mineral raw materials requires a vast amount of energy. That’s why procuring electricity and heat makes up a significant proportion of operating costs. Entities that supply their own electricity and heat using their own power plant will enjoy significant cost savings. And with a sturdy, state-of-the-art combined cycle power plant, they can also substantially improve their environmental life cycle assessment.",
        "From production to transportation and refining – the oil and gas business is getting tougher. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations are forcing many players to take action. Companies that invest in state-of-the-art on-site power generation enjoy multiple benefits – by curbing their emissions through the flexible use of available raw materials and also by using technologies that seamlessly integrate into their production systems. We provide you robust mechanical engineering that will operate reliably – even with frequent changes of load and fluctuating gas quality.",
        "Whether you process recycled fiber or use cellulose and lignin from the raw material wood, your systems will consume large volumes of electricity and heat. Generate your own process steam with an integrated power plant on-site. We offer plants with combined heat and power (CHP) in all scales to meet every need. That means you can remain flexible and independent over the long run.",
        "Mining is all about raw materials. When it comes to competition, it is production costs that matter – and energy costs are a key factor. The remote regions where raw materials are extracted are often not connected to public power networks. An on-site supply requires flexible facilities that can deliver power under tough conditions at low cost. Whether it’s for open-cast or underground mining, in cold or hot environments, as a standalone system or a back-up for renewable sources – we will design and build exactly the power plant solution you need to bolster your competitive position.",
        "Safety is paramount in chemical processes, and outages are both risky and costly – so your electricity supply must be totally reliable. This works best if you have your own generating system on-site, which will make you independent of external suppliers and curb costs in the long term. If a power plant also permits heat extraction, all the better – that will make your entire system even more efficient. We build the right solution for you – and integrate it seamlessly into your chain of processes.",
        "The energy landscape is changing. Small gas-fired power plants will be a mainstay of our energy supply system for the foreseeable future. That’s because they can serve as a flexible back-up for renewables, they’re highly efficient and operate reliably, and they can enable regions to function independently. On islands or at remote industrial sites, covering basic load or peak, with or without heat extraction – our industrial power plant solution will perfectly suit your specific requirements.",
        "The SGT-800 is the flagship of the Siemens portfolio of industrial gas turbines and provides excellent performance in combined cycle operation. It has proven itself in grid support and as a reliable backup for renewable energy sources. It is equally well-suited for independently supplying an industrial facility, with or without a grid connection. You can build on a fleet availability of over 97 percent.",
        "Get even more out of the energy in your fuel: A steam generator will use waste heat from the gas turbine to generate steam, which can drive a steam turbine. Combined cycle operation pays off.",
        "New gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability. ",
        "More than 1,500 power stations are in use around the world. Here are some of our top projects we have implemented with our customers.",
        "Do you want to supply your facility with power, reliably and cost-effectively? Or free yourself from reliance on a costly public supply? Do you need a flexible reserve power plant? Together we’ll find the perfect solution for your particular challenge.",
