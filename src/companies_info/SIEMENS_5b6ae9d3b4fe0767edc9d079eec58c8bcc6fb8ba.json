        "We offer a comprehensive range of single-stage radial compressors for applications in the metallurgical, oil and gas and chemical industries. These single-stage compressors are offered in a variety of designs. They can be configured with separate or integrated gearboxes, or as directly driven units. This allows to perfectly match the compressor with a wide range of prime movers including steam turbines and electric motors to meet customer preferences and specific site conditions.",
        "Our single stage centrifugal compressor is the perfect fit for atmospheric air compression at low pressure ratios. It covers a large flow range from small to very high volumes of up to 300,000 m³/h. This compressor uses well proven components from our integral geared compressor line and is designed in accordance with API 617. State-of-the-art aerodynamic parts allow a compact, single stage design. If necessary, an external gear box is used to match the driver speed. This modular design offers the advantage of an unchanged compressor design irrespective whether the machine is driven by a steam turbine, gas turbine or electric motor.",
        "Our single stage overhung compressor boasts a simple and robust design with well referenced components, smaller dimensions and less weight at the highest efficiency level, and low maintenance requirements.",
        "In case of higher pressure ratio requirements, the configuration comprises two single stage overhung machines driven by a double-ended steam turbine drive between the compressors.",
