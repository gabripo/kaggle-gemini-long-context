        "Extension for Various Applications",
        " The ME4 is a modular extension for embedded applications in transportation, e.g., in trains or wayside. The module adds wireless connectivity, fieldbus and audio functionality to the system CPU. Its main applications include predictive maintenance, IoT gateway, diagnostics server, smart vehicle, passenger information and ticketing systems.",
        "Wireless Connectivity",
        " The ME4 comes with one M.2 slot for high-speed LTE modems (LTE Advanced or LTE) providing two front-accessible micro-SIM card slots. For GPS/GLONASS functions, the box has an onboard GNSS receiver which can be connected via antenna connector.",
        "Fieldbus and Audio Functionality",
        " The ME4 is equipped with one PCI Express Mini Card slot prepared for an additional MVB, CAN bus or audio module. The functions can be made available on two D-Sub connectors at the front panel.",
        "Modular System for Easy Configuration",
        " Within duagon's modular concept, the ME4 offers flexibility in built-to-order configurations. Via its extension connectors, the box can be easily combined with duagon CPU modules or other extension modules, for example a PSU or removable storage shuttles, providing additional features and short delivery times.",
        " In the modular system, data transfer between the modules as well as the power distribution between the individual components takes place via the duagon-standardized extension connectors.",
        "Flexible System Installation",
        " Various mounting options facilitate the integration of the box into an existing environment. The standard 35 mm DIN Rail mounting offers space saving mounting of all system modules on a single rail. Wall mounting and mounting in a 19\" rack using adaption brackets are an option.",
        " The aluminum housing with cooling fins allows for fanless operation. The ME4 is maintenance free without moving parts.",
        "Rolling Stock Qualified and Long-Term Availability",
        " The wireless and fieldbus module is qualified for rolling stock and wayside applications. Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
