        "The Type A™ bushing is a stud-type design offering an economical and versatile bushing for any application. ​\r\n​\r\nDue to the simple design and rugged construction, these bushings require little maintenance other than periodic cleaning. The bushings can be mounted at any angle from horizontal to vertical. They are available in voltage ratings from 1.2 kV to 34.5 kV. ​\r\n​\r\nBushings rated 600 amperes and lower have draw-lead conductors, which allow bushings to be removed from service without disturbing connections inside the equipment. Fixed conductor bushings are available in current ratings through 18,000 amperes.​",
