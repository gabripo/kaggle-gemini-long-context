        "Your advantages with WHRS",
        "Siemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens.",
        "With the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system.",
        "Your advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC",
        "The synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent.",
        "The SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control, and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC.",
        "SISHIP BlueDrive Eco combines the experience from both systems SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC and SISHIP EcoProp. SISHIP EcoProp is well known as a flexible, compact, high-power diesel-electric propulsion system for smaller vessels such as yachts, ferries, and public authority vessels. Like the complete SISHIP BlueDrive Family, SISHIP BlueDrive Eco uses the Siemens Energy industrial converter platform components, providing very high reliability and availability. It enables scalable systems from 5 kW inverter power use and closes the power range (to BlueDrive PlusC up to 5.5 MW inverter power), all in the same topology.",
        "The advanced lithium-ion battery-based solution BlueVault for offshore installations and marine vessels is suited for both all-electric and hybrid energy-storage applications. BlueVault energy storage solutions are designed to help ensure continuity of power and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions.",

The cubicles can be easily lined up to the total required battery capacity.",
        "A fundamental requirement of submarines is to run silently and remain submerged in certain situations. Conventional diesel-electric drive models need to periodically surface to recharge their batteries, making the boat vulnerable. Our PEM fuel cells deliver an atmospheric air-independent, noiseless propulsion solution for power generation on board that can extend the dive time by several weeks.",
        "The PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be extended to weeks, if required, which significantly minimizes the risk of being detected. That’s because the PEM fuel cell modules use oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity, so the potential dive time is restricted only by the supply of stored media and the boat’s energy demand. The system works without atmospheric air and is completely exhaust-free.",
        "Another important advantage is that the PEM fuel cell has an ultimately low signature in operation: This helps reducing the aggregate acoustic signature of the submarine. The system’s noise signature lies well under all threshold values. With their electrochemical properties, the fuel cells themselves operate noiselessly. Even the ancillary units are optimized for low noise or can be easily incorporated into noise encapsulation thanks to their compact design.",
        "Your advantages with PEM fuel cells",
        "The operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system. Our SG-DC supply and switching system delivers a reliable power supply to the propulsion system and the various onboard networks.",
        "To secure the optimum power supply for your boat in any situation, SG-DC ensures the supply, distribution, and monitoring of electrical energy for the propulsion system and all onboard networks. It is the ideal equipment for meeting the specific requirements of submarines with respect to shock and vibration resistance, electromagnetic shielding and acoustics, and external influences such as temperature, air humidity, and air pressure.",
        "SG-DC incorporates the main control panel for connecting the energy producers to the propulsion system, and also the auxiliary power distribution for the individual consumers and all onboard networks. The system is tailored to the individual requirements of every boat and its key characteristics are superb reliability, compact build, and low maintenance.",
        "Your advantages with DC switchgear",
