        "As renewable energy production increases, operators are challenged to supply reliable energy at premium cost-efficiency. Siemens Energy BlueVault™ storage solutions promote on-demand, dispatchable renewable power, increase profitability during fluctuating demand, optimize on-site power sources, capitalize on peak loads (while reducing demand charges), increase conventional power plant flexibility, and provide operating reserves while improving the security of your energy supply. Our team uses innovative design and simulation tools to tailor an agnostic technology portfolio to your specific requirements.",
        "BlueVault™ energy storage solutions are an advanced lithium-ion battery-based solution, suited for both all-electric and hybrid energy-storage applications. BlueVault™ is designed to help ensure continuity of power and to minimize emissions, with an end goal of a low-emission platform. The battery is designed to maximize life, performance and safety. BlueVault™ can be installed in newbuild as well as retrofit diesel-electric power plants and in all type vessels, drilling or FPSO.",
        "Up to some years ago, the marine and offshore market required assets which were oversized in capacity. Reason for this were the class requirement for safe operations, the operators need for having a “robust” power plant, and a general not focus on efficiency and green solutions. Siemens Energy is focused on the complete project lifecycle.",
        "Siemens Energy BlueVault™ storage solution enables on-demand and dispatchable power, increases and optimizes the reliability and availability of power generation, increase conventional power plant flexibility, and provide operating reserves while improving the security of your energy supply. Our team uses innovative design and simulation tools to tailor an agnostic technology portfolio to your specific requirements.",
        "Contribution to a decarbonized future​",
        "​The system contains a containerized BlueVault battery storage, inverter system and transformer connection to power station. Based on the BlueVault technology we deliver a system that enables the customer Aneo to optimize the production of energy from the power station by peak power control, energy allocation and frequency stabilization",
