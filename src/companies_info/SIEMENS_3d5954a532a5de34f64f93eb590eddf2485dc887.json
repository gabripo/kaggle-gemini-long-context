        "Driving the performance and efficiency of paper productions to the max",
        "The paper industry is facing challenges that could not be more contradictory. While investment budgets are under constant pressure, customers all over the world are demanding product quality that's virtually impossible to achieve using outdated technology. At the same time, continuously growing expenses for energy and raw materials are dramatically increasing cost pressures, while the competition is getting more and more aggressive. To master these challenges, we've developed innovative drive solutions for paper mills, finishing machines, slitter winders, and rewinders: SIPAPER Drives APL and SIPAPER Winder APL simplify operations, optimize diagnostic capabilities, meet the highest safety standards, maximize efficiency, and minimize maintenance costs.",
        "If the product quality demanded in international competition can't be achieved with existing technologies, budgets are under cost pressure, and the cost of energy and raw materials are increasing, there's only one solution that makes sense: increase system performance with specific investments in your control technology and in modern, energy-efficient drive technology.",
        "Our innovative drive solutions SIPAPER Drives APL and SIPAPER Winder APL are made to tackle the challenges of the paper industry. The modules are based on SIMATIC PCS 7, the leading process control system worldwide, which perfectly integrates the functionality of the drives to create a powerful system with the highest availability. The automation controller ensures the functionality of rapid digital control and calculation tasks for the drives. The operator interface is available as a high-end operator station in server-client or stand-alone architecture for control and monitoring, including comprehensive fault diagnostics. Panels provide a user-friendly solution for local operation.",
        "With our proven and precisely coordinated components and standardized technology modules, you can also integrate higher-value control functions with minimum engineering effort. And with the industry-specific control and diagnostic functions of SIPAPER Drives APL and SIPAPER Winder APL, you'll also benefit from high-availability paper production with optimal quality across all plant components, from the paper machine to the finishing machine and reel slitter. SIPAPER Safety Integrated is an integral part of SIPAPER Drives APL and SIPAPER Winder APL, which complies with all legal safety requirements as standard.",
        " SIPAPER Drives APL for sectional drive systems optimizes process observation and monitoring",
        "Achieving consistent paper quality with continuously increasing throughput and a greater diversity of grades are central challenges for the pulp and paper industry. To meet these challenges, the functional modules of the Advanced Process Library of SIPAPER Drives APL offer open-ended, modular drive solutions. The range of applications of SIPAPER Drives APL extends from partial modernization to complete turnkey solutions.
