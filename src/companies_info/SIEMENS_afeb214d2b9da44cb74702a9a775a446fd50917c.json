        "It’s often a challenge to ensure a reliable power supply in the grid if the demand is rising. We offer solutions for a grid connectivity that helps to ensure energy security as well as reliability and that allows for power to be efficiently distributed and used across a wide area. ",
        "Integration of renewable energy:",
        "We play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind farms or solar power plants, into the grid. We thus enable the transmission of renewable power from resource-rich areas to population centers, reducing dependance on fossil fuels and promoting a clean energy mix.",
        "Covering rising energy demand:",
        "We enhance the grid infrastructure and meet the rising energy demand.",
        "Industry electrification & energy access:",
        "We bring affordable and reliable energy to remote and underserved areas, thus facilitating energy access and socio-economic development.",
        "International energy trade optimization:",
        "We foster international energy trading by allowing energy surpluses to be exported or imported, thus enhancing energy security, and optimizing resource utilization.",
