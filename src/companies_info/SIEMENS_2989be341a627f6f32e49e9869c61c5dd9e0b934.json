        "Single-shaft centrifugal compressors with flexible design and a wide application range ",
        "From standard processes to high-pressure applications, our single-shaft compressors are the ideal solution for a wide range of industries and process applications. They are designed to customer specifications and API 617 standards. Compression solutions can be supplied in a variety of configurations from skid mounted, combining the compressor with its driver and auxiliaries, to single lift process modules where we can fully integrate compressors, drivers and process equipment such as coolers, scrubbers, separators, piping, and wiring. Module fabrication can be done in our yard or contracted out to qualified yards in destination countries to fulfill local content requirements.      ",
        "Covering a wide performance range in terms of pressure ratio and volume flow, our horizontally split single-shaft compressors can compress gases with suction temperatures as low as required for LNG boil-off gas service (-160 °C / -256 °F).",
        "Several process stages can be housed in each casing depending on process requirements. These include straight-through, back-to-back or double flow configurations while side streams and intercooling can be accommodated as well. Up to three casings can be arranged in line to be driven by a single prime mover. The horizontal casing split allows for easy access to the compressor internals for inspection and maintenance without the need to remove the casing from the base plate or to detach process gas piping. Depending on process specifics, optional adjustable inlet guide vanes in front of the first impeller can optimize energy efficiency under part load conditions.",
        "Our vertically split single-shaft compressors (barrel type) cover a wide performance range in terms of volume flow and pressure ratio with up to 1,000 bar / 14,500 psi discharge pressure. They allow for ultra-low suction temperatures (down to -160 °C / -256 °F) required for LNG boil-off gas service.",
        "Evolving from our world class DATUM and STC centrifugal compressors, meet the STC-SVm. The STC-SVm platform incorporates the best of the best technologies from our existing compressor portfolio combining well proven components with cutting edge features.",
        "Several process stages and side streams can be included in each casing depending on process requirements, including intercooling. All compressor internals are arranged as a bundle that can be pulled horizontally out of the casing to allow easy access for inspection and maintenance. This configuration eliminates the need to remove gas piping. Depending on process specifics, optional adjustable inlet guide vanes in front of the first impeller can optimize energy efficiency under part load conditions.",
        "We’re excited to introduce our latest development, the advanced hydrogen turbocompressor, designed to serve pure hydrogen, hydrogen-rich, and other low mole weight applications.",
        "Our goal is to minimize your ongoing wet oil seal costs, unscheduled downtime and resulting productivity losses. ",
        "Our Remote Diagnostic Service (RDS) satisfies the increasing requirements placed on turbocompressors by various industries and applications. We offer recommendations and advise you on optimizing equipment operation, preventing operational disturbances and unplanned outages, and performing preventive maintenance.",
