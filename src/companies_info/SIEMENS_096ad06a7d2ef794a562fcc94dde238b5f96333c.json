        "From power transformers to HVDC transformers, these key components are crucial for a seamless, uninterrupted power supply. Despite their ruggedness and reliability, they are susceptible to aging and wear over their decades of use.",
        "Why Siemens Energy? Transformer Lifecycle Management (TLM) - a strategic way to increase value. TLM allows for targeted expenditure planning and controlled timing of new investments, avoiding unforeseen outages and minimizing planned downtimes. It also reduces environmental impact while maximizing transformer availability. This service concept applies to all transformers in your network, irrespective of age, manufacturer, or power. We service all generations of transformers.  TLM is designed to prevent unplanned downtimes and optimize planned maintenance measures. We recognize that even planned service interruptions have increasingly shorter windows. Our solution includes mobile technologies and methods, with expert teams that provide on-site support. From oil-drying systems to high-voltage testing stations, our mobile repair workshops are fast, flexible, and can be integrated into your operations. This complements the performance spectrum of Siemens Energy's repair facility, enhancing service reliability.",
        "Our time- and condition-based maintenance services follow original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations to slow down the aging process of transformers, extending their lifespan and efficiency. We offer specialized services including oil regeneration, transformer drying, and moisture monitoring to prevent damage and ensure peak performance. Our local qualified experts conduct on-site investigations and provide comprehensive repair solutions, including parts and materials, failure analysis, and on-site transformer repair using a mobile facility for efficiency and convenience.",
        "DIAG ensures the reliability and longevity of transformers through comprehensive diagnostic modules that assess individual transformers and entire fleets. The service offers three levels of assessment, including inspection, diagnostics, and high voltage testing, providing transparent and objective evaluations for informed decision-making. Experienced service professionals provide detailed test reports with recommended actions to prevent unexpected failures and maximize transformer utilization. By utilizing DIAG, transformer owners and operators can optimize maintenance strategies, avoid unplanned outages, and improve overall safety and security of operation.  ",
        "Our services include insulating oil analyses and material testing, which involve diagnostic test procedures for ageing analysis, condition detection, and new state assessments of oils and insulating materials. The lifespan of a transformer depends on the ageing of the insulating materials, and our services aim to recognize material degradation and extend transformer lifespan through trend analysis and targeted maintenance. The Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers comprehensive services, including sample collection, analysis, and assessment, to identify ageing processes and ensure reliable performance.",
        "Depending on the initial situation, it may be expedient from an economic standpoint to have an older or damaged transformer overhauled at one of our Siemens Energy production locations. Based on our experience, an overhaul restores transformer availability for an extended time with no restrictions in operating reliability. There are advantages over the production of a new transformer. An overhaul and restoration are usually significantly more cost-effective and time-efficient. Our customers also experience significantly shorter outage times.",
        "In many cases, it is not possible or cost-effective to bring the transformer to one of our manufacturing plants for repair because of the necessary heavy transport.",
        "In these cases we can offer our customers on-site repair. An individual solution may be elaborated depending on the existing infrastructure.",
        "See the animation:",
        "REG, the online regeneration technology, can clean aged or corrosive transformer oil, restore its dielectric properties, and increase the transformer availability. Regeneration processes requires special equipment, high competence, and long-time experience of staff. Siemens Energy operators have experience in online regeneration of more than 300 transformers with different design, connections and at various ambient temperatures. REG, removes degradation products and corrosive compounds from transformer oil during normal transformer operations. This not only ensures operational efficiency but also offers substantial economic and ecological advantages. ",
        "Power transformers degrade over time, with moisture in the insulating paper hastening this process. This moisture can come from insufficient drying during production, environmental damage, or the degradation process itself. A single oil treatment won't have a lasting effect as 98% of the moisture is in the insulating paper.  Siemens Energy's TLM method effectively slows down the unavoidable aging process within your transformers, thus extending their lifespan. Our widely recognized DRY is a stationary and continuous transformer drying system.",
        "In addition to our repair and maintenance services, we provide modernization of hardware and software with state-of-the-art versions. We also offer retrofitting of individual components to maintain delivery capacity, as well as overhauling transformers to ensure optimal functionality. Furthermore, we provide system-wide feature upgrades and performance enhancements to meet evolving operational needs.",
        "Do you need help on a concrete project? Do you need a quote for any of our products or solutions? Do you need support for your installed equipment? Do you have a technical question? Do you need something totally different? You can contact us 24/7. We are looking forward to your request.",
