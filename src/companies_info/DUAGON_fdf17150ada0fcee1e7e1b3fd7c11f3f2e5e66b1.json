        "The panel PC DC2 is a rugged, fanless and maintenance-free human-machine interface (HMI) for interactive applications in transportation and industrial automation. It is designed for panel mounting and equipped with a 10.4\" 4:3 LCD TFT display with a capacitive touch panel.",
        " The DC2 is controlled by the Intel Atom XL Z520PT running at 1.33 GHz and comes with 1 GB of DDR2 SDRAM and a built-in 2-GB microSD card. The standard interfaces comprise 2 Fast Ethernet (via RJ45 connectors) and 2 USB ports as well as four binary inputs (via the 10-pin power supply connector).",
        " The two Ethernet interfaces have switch functionality to provide Ethernet connection to subsequent intelligent displays. A temperature sensor is provided to monitor and controlthe display. All I/O signals are concentrated at the bottom of the unit.",
        " The DC2 is equipped with an internal 10 V to 36 V (12 VDC nom. or 24 VDC nom.) wide-range power supply and able to operate in a -40°C to +70°C environment (+85°C for 10 minutes). It complies with the EN 50155, class Tx railway standard when used with an optional includable PSU suited for railway applications. All electronic components are soldered to withstand shock and vibration and prepared for conformal coating.",
        " The unit's control electronics are directly attached to the back of the display, hence bigger screen sizes or other aspect ratios can be realized easily. Further options include other types of the Intel Atom XL processor, M12 connectors for the Ethernet interfaces, a serial interface or GPS adapter that can be added via an SA-Adapter, HD audio via a D-Sub connector and an antenna connector. A PCI Express Mini card slot (with a SIM card slot) in combination with an external antenna can be used to incorporate wireless functions like GPS, GLONASS, Wi-Fi, WIMAX, GSM/GPRS, UMTS, HSDPA and LTE.",
