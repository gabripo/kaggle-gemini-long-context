        "With climate targets set and the energy transition well underway, fossil fuels are going to be used in lower quantities. For heat and power production, flexibility and independence in fuels are becoming more and more important.",
        "A variety of green fuels, both hydrogen and e-fuels (fuels from electricity) as well as sustainable biofuels all have an important role for decarbonization of power and heat. ",
        "Biofuels like biogas, biodiesel, bio-methanol and bioethanol are beside hydrogen important decarbonized fuels and part of our gas turbine R&D roadmap at Siemens Energy. Shift to operation of new greener fuels can be done in new and already existing gas turbines without any major adaptations.",
        "Flexible Combined Heat and Power plants with gas turbines operated on hydrogen or biofuels can both provide efficiencies over 90% and the needed flexibility to the electricity sector. ",
        "Another advantage with gas turbine plants is that they can be situated in proximity to larger cities and provide district heating or back up also in times when transmission of renewable electricity to the cities is insufficient or not working properly. ",
        "Biofuels can be produced from a variety of organic sources, including biodegradable waste, or residues from agriculture and forestry. They come in many forms, like solid biomass, liquid biodiesel, and biogas.",
        "A dual-fuel gas turbine can switch between liquid or gaseous biofuels is as needed. The technology is already proven and ready to go - on biofuels alone or mixed with hydrogen, or other fossil free fuels - as they become available.",
        "Learn more about two projects that lay the foundation for our biofuels development",
        "Successful operation verified in 2022 on Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) at the Rya Combined Heat and Power Plant containing 3 x SGT-800 gas turbines in combined cycle with a steam turbine for electricity and district heating (total efficiency 92,5%).",
        "A new simple cycle back-up power plant based on the SGT-800 gas turbine will provide balancing power to the city of Stockholm (start up in 10 minutes to 50 MW). The plant will operate on liquid green bio-diesel, enabling Stockholm Exergy to reach their target of becoming climate positive by 2025.",
