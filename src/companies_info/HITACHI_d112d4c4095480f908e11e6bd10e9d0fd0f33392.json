        "Gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear (GIS) is a compact metal encapsulated switchgear consisting of high-voltage components such as circuit-breakers and disconnectors, which can be safely operated in confined spaces. GIS is used where space is limited, for example, extensions, in city buildings, on roofs, on offshore platforms, industrial plants and hydropower plants. Hitachi Energy has always been and continues to drive innovation in GIS technology in ratings, operations, switching technology, smart control and supervision, and compactness. As a result, Hitachi Energy's GIS offers outstanding reliability, operational safety and environmental compatibility. It provides a complete range of products for all ratings and applications from 72.5 kV to 1200 kV matching current and future requirements for modern switchgear.\r\n ",
