        "Digital I/O for Railway",
        " The SA15N provides five digital inputs, five digital outputs and three digital bidirectional inputs/outputs. The supported logic level is 3.3 V up to 24 V. The output current for each channel is 500 mA (sinking), but the maximum overall current is 2.5 A.",
        "Versatile I/O Features",
        " SA-Adapters are small universal boards providing the line drivers for legacy serial I/O, fieldbus interfaces and other I/O functions. One serial line is provided per adapter, which can be plugged directly to duagon products such as CPU boards as a mezzanine. Alternatively, the adapter can be connected to the front panel via ribbon cable.",
        "Interface Extensibility",
        " The SA concept allows to add additional I/O interfaces to duagon products, enhancing flexibility for line transceivers and isolation requirements. Compatibility of SA-Adapters or a combination thereof with duagon products is determined by mechanical, performance, FPGA and operating system criteria and needs to be verified for every board configuration requested.",
        "Suitable for Railway Applications",
        " The SA15N complies with the EN 50155 standard for use in railway applications.",
        "Long-Term Availability",
        " Long-term availability ensures an extended product life and future-safety.",
