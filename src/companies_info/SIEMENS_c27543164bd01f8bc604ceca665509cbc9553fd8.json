        "Sector coupling is the energetic link of sectors like power, energy, mobility, industry or building. It acts as a link between renewable energy sources (wind, solar, water...) and consumers.",
        "Power-to-X as the key technology in sector coupling allows us to transform and save energy from renewable resources in a chemical form for long-term storage and use, with green hydrogen and its derivatives as the core component. ",
        "Discover how Power-to-X technology is transforming the energy landscape, harmonizing diverse sectors and paving the way for a sustainable future. Watch the video!",
        "Discover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video!",
        "Elyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors.",
        "With our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition. The \"P\" denotes Proton Exchange Membrane technology.",
        "Our proven solutions remain unchanged, supporting efficient production of green hydrogen.",
        "With our new name, we strengthen our position as a leading provider in this important field and invite you to become part of the hydrogen revolution.",
        "Power-to-X (PtX) and hybrid solutions are always a subset of the energy landscape shown in the image. In PtX applications, hydrogen is converted into molecules along the energy landscape via a synthesis process, but no re-electrification takes place.",
        "The provision of renewable energy in the form of green hydrogen and its derivatives opens up new business areas and offers additional benefits. With our technical know-how and additional services, we provide you with optimal Power-to-X solutions.",
        "Green hydrogen can be used to produce various types of synthetic fuels like eKerosene, eMethanol, eAmmonia and eGasoline, which support the decarbonization of the aviation, shipping, fertilizer and transportation industry. In energy-intensive industries like steel production, it can replace gray hydrogen and other substances directly through green hydrogen production.",
        "In the future, non-fossil e-Methanol will see vast new application fields. This paper focuses on the green hydrogen path, which uses renewable electricity:",
        "e-Kerosene and sustainable aviation fuels are solutions that help to reduce the carbon carbon footprint of air travel, paving the way for a greener future:",
        "Find out more about the economic feasibility, key markets and applications of e-Ammonia around the world in connection with Power-to-X:",
        "The generation of renewable energies is one side of the coin. How can you ensure a reliable and constantly available energy supply for your system in a cost-effective way? Discover the right solution for your project!",
        "Grid connected Power-to-X projects provide stable power-supply, however, they are facing challenges regarding grid code requirements as well as regulatory boundary conditions. We take care of seamless connection and interaction with the grid, dispatch control according to regulatory requirements (e.g. hourly correlation) as well as digital certification of your product in terms of CO₂ footprint.",
        "Siemens Energy is the only manufacturer of Power-to-X solutions with the portfolio, experience and knowledge of power generation and grid connection. We use our expertise and our tolls for system design and simulation to determine optimum technical and economic solutions for you. As an additional benefit, electrolysis can be used as a fast energy balancing unit and its end products as energy storage.",
        "Off-Grid Power-to-X projects provide advantages regarding compliance with regulatory requirements due to inherent geographic and timely correlation. In addition, grid utilization charges can be avoided. The biggest challenge for off-grid or weak-grid projects lies in designing the grid forming and stabilizing equipment in close connection with an integrated control system. Siemens Energy has acquired significant experience in modelling complex island grids from renewables to the electrolyzers and other downstream consumers, which is the basis for simulation and optimization of essential grid stabilizing systems such as batteries, synchronous condensers or static converters.",
