        "Unlock the full capability of your power plant",
        "In the competitive power-generation market, power utilities are focused on optimizing performance while minimizing operational costs to deliver low-cost, high-quality energy to their customers. ",
        "However, there needs to be a balance in the trade-offs between performance, operational costs and risks.",
        "When it comes to fossil generation, performance optimization is directly related to operations cost. Using a Thermal Digital Twin based on data from the DCS for advanced control concepts without major changes to mechanical equipment is one of the options to increase your plants profitability.",
        "With Omnivise Performance you can adapt plant operations to your current requirements.",
        "CPO managed service focuses on the thermal performance of a power plant.",
        "The service is based on the comparison of a plant’s observed data to an ideal state of the power plant represented by the thermal digital twin.",
        "Continuous performance optimization (CPO) in a nutshell ",
        "*Based on actual case study; individual results may vary",
        "Your plan",
        "t data is pulled to a cloud where it gets sorted, checked for errors and run through the Siemens Energy proprietary rule base.",
        "Through the CPO application, you can view and sort the plant’s operation parameters in an user-friendly interface.",
        "If you, as the operator, notice a particular performance deviation, you can reach out the Siemens Energy experts directly via the application.",
        "We appreciate your interest in our product. If you have questions or need more information, feel free to contact us!",
