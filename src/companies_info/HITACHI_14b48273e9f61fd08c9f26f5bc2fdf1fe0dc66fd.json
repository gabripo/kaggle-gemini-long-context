        "Hitachi Energy strives to continuously increase the lifetime of your components. Using high-quality spare parts management, we are able to inform you what spare parts are needed to minimize unnecessary downtime. Since parts are not infinitely immune to wear and tear, you need to know how to achieve maximum availability throughout their lifetime.\n",
        "The main equipment normally has a longer lifetime than control system equipment. Replacements can generally be directly introduced without design changes, but in some cases, minor updates may be necessary and are therefore offered case by case.",
        "Spare parts are supplied as per contractually agreed spare parts-list in the FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) delivery contract, additional spare parts are then ordered separately or within the FACTS Care Agreement.",
