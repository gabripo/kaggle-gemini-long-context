        "Whether you are installing a new, repaired, or refurbished unit or if it is a reallocation of an existing unit, Hitachi Energy offers a secure and efficient solution to meet your needs. We can offer a packaged solution, including disassembly in preparation for transportation, packaging of sensitive components, transportation of the unit, reassembly at the site, complete installation, and commissioning of the unit. This can also be tailored to your needs and shipment requirements by our personnel or channel partners at your site(s).",
        "Depending on the size of the unit and the transport conditions, the transformer may be dispatched completely or partly assembled. Larger transformers must be dispatched with bushings, a conservator, and cooling equipment, and all minor accessories must be disassembled.",
        "Many transformers must be transported without oil and filled with dry air. The transformer oil is transported in specially treated barrels or by tanker. The weight and size of large transformers require careful planning and preparation for transport and installation.",
        "Hitachi Energy has extensive experience in delivering all types of transformers to all parts of the world. The combination of highly qualified technicians, local expertise, and high-quality equipment enhances the speed and efficiency of this vital operation.",
