        "Today Static frequency converters are applied in many applications involving the generation, transmission, distribution and use of electrical energy. Their inherent capability to control voltage, frequency and power flow brings flexibility and energy efficiency to a new level. Developments in power electronics have reduced their cost and increased their power rating. Through their capability to integrate renewable energy sources, to reduce energy consumption, or to enable environmentally friendly transport systems, they contribute to a more sustainable world. ",
        "Hitachi Energy has more than 40 years of experience in high power medium voltage SFCs for various applications, such as Rail power supplies, hydro pumped storage power plants or grid interties. Our converters are designed to meet very high standards of efficiency and reliability. Simple and cost-efficient maintenance together with a long lifetime enable minimized lifecycle cost of the SFCs. ",
