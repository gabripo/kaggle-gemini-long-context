        "Efficient diesel-electric propulsion system with twin or mono propellers",
        "Electric pod systems are widely used on diesel-electric-powered vessels where very high levels of maneuverability, efficiency, and reliability are required. With SISHIP SiPOD-M (mono propeller) and SISHIP SiPOD-T (twin propeller), Siemens Energy offers a solution in the power range from 5 MW to 23 MW that allows maximum flexibility in vessel design and layout thanks to minimal space requirement on board. The crucial advantage of SISHIP SiPOD-M/-T is the substantially higher overall efficiency resulting from the combination of a compact, hydrodynamically optimized design and efficient, permanently excited synchronous motor.",
        "In the area of electric pod-based systems, Siemens Energy is the only supplier of podded propulsion systems equipped optionally with twin or mono propellers. This means that the propulsion system can be optimally adapted for your needs, all depending on the type of vessel and operating profile. Whether you opt for a twin or mono propeller version, you benefit from an innovative drive system that meets your requirements fully.",
        "Sailing open waters is an extraordinary task for every vessel. Not only the ship itself, but also its propulsion systems have to operate on the highest level of performance. With the mono-propeller propulsion system SISHIP SiPOD-M, Siemens offers you a solution for vessels facing performance and efficiency challenges in these waters.",
        "The SISHIP SiPOD-M is the podded system of choice for vessels with demanding requirements in terms of open water performance and efficiency. The SISHIP SiPOD-M is equipped with an optimized strut which prevents vibrations and increases course stability. The hydrodynamic efficiency is even further increased thanks to the slim propeller hub and streamlined design. Cruise ships and other large passenger vessels, megayachts, as well as special vessels with specific ice class requirements particularly benefit from the advantages of the SISHIP SiPOD-M.",
        "If you are looking for a high vessel design flexibility and payload capacity at the same time, our SISHIP SiPOD-T twin-propeller propulsion system is the right choice for you.",
        "Twin propeller systems keep space requirements under the stern to an absolute minimum. The SISHIP SiPOD-T allows for more flexible ship designs and maximizes the payload capacity. This is an advantage especially for ferries, special vessels, and naval support vessels.",
        "Having electrical properties resembling those of a conventional synchronized motor, the permanently excited motor can be integrated without limitations into conventional drive systems. In the process, the higher level of availability of the diesel-electric outboard drives also leads to a marked increase in operational reliability. No other type of drive system offers comparable flexibility for designing hulls and engine rooms than azimuthing diesel-electric propulsion systems.",
        "The loss of even one day of vessel deployment due to a breakdown or failure can significantly impact your balance sheet. Like you, we are well aware of these challenges and address them with special offerings such as our fully equipped SISHIP SiPOD Service Container.",
        "To be prepared for on-site conditions, which can sometimes be harsh, the fully equipped SISHIP SiPOD Service Container contains both standard and special-purpose tools, lifting devices, air-conditioning and heating equipment. Together with our new logistics concept, this allows us to substantially decrease maintenance times and also better access and reduce any risks while maintenance is being performed.",
        "A material container has recently complemented the Siemens Energy SISHIP SiPOD workshop container with all necessary tools for podded drive maintenance. This container additionally acts as an extension of the workshop space. It carries empty material boxes for dismounted large components, such as shaft bearings. This ensures safe transportation at the shipyard and beyond, and also protects sensitive parts regardless of the outside conditions. Overall, the SISHIP SiPOD material container boosts the shipyard’s independence. ",
        "If you want to learn more about our offering for the marine sectors, don’t hesitate to contact us. Our marine experts will gladly answer all your questions and provide you with comprehensive information.",
