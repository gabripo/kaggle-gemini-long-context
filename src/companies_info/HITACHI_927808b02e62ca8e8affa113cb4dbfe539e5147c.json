        "Cooling systems protect the transformer from accelerated aging by lowering the operating temperature and therefore avoid insulation disruptions leading to transformer failure.",
        "The effect of a malfunctioning cooling system could cause significant disruptions to the availability of the transformer as well as the remaining life. By upgrading the cooling capacity, capital optimization could also be achieved by increasing the rated capacity of the transformer. A well-functioned cooling system requires regular maintenance. Depending on the type, the life expectancy of the cooling devices can be much shorter than the transformer active part and tank.",
        "Cooling system replacement/upgrades: The need to replace or upgrade the cooling system can emerge from a variety of situations, such as old age, “wear and tear,” the move of the transformer, and adaptation to new design technology. Upgrades of cooling systems enable an increase in the loading capacity of the transformer.",
        "Coolers are cleaned by brushing inside the water tubes or by air-side vacuum cleaning when necessary. The need for cleaning is indicated by increased pressure loss, decreased temperature-difference oil/water/air in/out, increased transformer temperature, decreased water flow, etc. See the manufacturer’s documentation.",
        "For cooling systems, our offering covers the following key components:",
