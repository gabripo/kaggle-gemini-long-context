        "With over 150 years of experience, Siemens-Energy is a world leader in generator technology and has manufactured many of the largest and most efficient generators in the world.",
        "With Siemens-Energy as your service partner, you can have the full benefits of the expertise of our turbine-generator factory personnel, design engineering, service engineering groups, and our regional management and service expertise. We are knowledgeable of potential turbine-generator issues through significant fleet experience and have developed an enormous backlog of field processes, procedures, tooling and trained personnel to quickly address them.",

        "Siemens Energy has +30 years of providing robotic In-Situ generator inspections known as FAST Gen. The three inspection scopes offered are Visual, Siemens Multifrequency Core Assessment System (SMCAS™️) and Wedge Tightness. The visual inspection utilizes on board camera(s) that are capable of digitally recording video and still images used to look for visual signs of overheating, excessive relative motion, ventilation blockages in stator or rotor vent paths and possible foreign objects. SMCAS™️ is a test that evaluates core laminations for circulating currents the same as EL CID. A feature that SMCAS™️ offers is the ability to digitally overlay previously recorded SMCAS™️results to compare for trending over the life cycle of the stator core. Wedge Tightness testing is used to assess the loading force of generator stator wedges and is a helpful tool to predict a possible outage of sufficient length when loose or loosening stator wedges need to be replaced.",
        "With 3 decades of field use comes significant innovation. Siemens Energy at the Pittsburgh Service Center has begun to incorporate additive manufacturing to the latest design updates that allow for more rapid customization of inspection components that can be attached to the modular base of the FAST Gen tooling or even complete standalone solutions. This enables the Pittsburgh Service Center to help meet an ever-increasing demand of non-OEM inspection requests where generator access may offer unique obstacles.",
        "Loop Testing is performed to identify and restore insulation between core laminations, (if interlaminar insulation has broken down).",
        "High Frequency Flux Test",
        "Modal analysis determines the natural frequencies and mode shapes of turbine-generator static structures across the relevant frequency ranges of operation. Testing ensures that during operation the structure is tuned away from resonant conditions that increases structure fatigue and chance of failure. Modal analysis can be performed in the field or the factory.",
        "Modal analysis applications include:",
        "Further comprehensive Siemens Generator Service Capabilities can be offered upon request.",
        "If you have any questions or would like to find out how we can help you to modernize your generator equipment, please let us know.",
