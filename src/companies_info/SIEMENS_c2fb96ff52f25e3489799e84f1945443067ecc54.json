        "Worldwide, offshore wind farms are growing in number and size as global demand for renewable energy increases. Additionally, the subsidies for wind power are ending. To keep pace, reliable and cyber-secured control solutions are required to optimize operations and to manage the fleet of wind and other generating units over the complete lifecycle. Advancements in offshore wind generation controls enable operators to monitor and automate individual turbines and their communication networks. SCADA technology allows for these individual offshore wind turbine generators to be interconnected and viewed through a single platform. Tools and systems for direct marketing of wind power on the intraday, spot, and balancing energy market help wind farm operators remain competitive.  ",
        "We kindly invite you to join us at our booth B6.379 in Hall 6 at WindEnergy Hamburg 2024 from September 24-27 and discuss how our integrated controls approach can help boost flexibility and resilience across the lifecycle for your offshore wind park. ",

        "Virtual Power Plant is a decision support tool to optimize revenue and resource use based on the combination of different generation technologies. For example, we can help you to maximize your benefit if you decide to expand your offshore wind farm with hydrogen storage: Every 15 minutes, Virtual Power Plant delivers forecast data to the electrolyzer on wind feed-in, as well as gas and electricity consumption. The receiving interface converts this data directly into control commands for the electrolyzer. Depending on price forecasts and the current utilization of the gas and electricity network, the VPP remotely starts and stops the electrolyzer, while at the same time standing by to deliver control reserve to the national grid at any moment. The fast-response nature of an electrolysis plant allows to participate in the balancing energy and primary control power markets. Virtual Power Plant allows you to make a decisive contribution to a stable power supply and at the same time actively promote the economic efficiency of green hydrogen.",
