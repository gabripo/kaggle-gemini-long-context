        "Power plants can only operate reliably in the long term if all of their various systems work together smoothly: only this way, unplanned outages can be avoided. Central to ensuring this kind of consistently smooth interaction is preventive maintenance.",
        "Siemens Energy provides a comprehensive range of preventive maintenance services for power plant electrical and I&C systems. Our regular inspections as part of periodic plant maintenance activities, clever spare parts concepts, long-term solutions to extend service life and our intelligent diagnostics solutions bring a genuinely preventive element to plant maintenance and detect faults before they can trigger costly failures.",
        "Our preventive maintenance always also includes efficiency-boosting features for optimal plant operation with life cycle maintenance costs minimized. We help operators to safeguard long-term power plant availability while simultaneously saving money on plant maintenance.",
        "Regular inspection and maintenance of electrical and I&C systems",
        "Scheduled periodic maintenance of electrical and I&C systems is vital to avoid power plant outages and the associated high costs. It makes sense to coordinate the inspection of all maintenance groups so as to avoid extended shutdowns and to plan time-based maintenance activities to minimize costs.",
        "Siemens Energy assumes responsibility for the planning, coordination and performance of time-based maintenance. We carry out the inspection and maintenance of electrical and I&C system components while your turbines are being overhauled to make optimal use of downtime and keep maintenance costs to a minimum.",
        "Our position as an OEM means we have all of the expertise necessary for the inspection and maintenance of our I&C systems including field devices and our own as well as third-party electrical components. In addition to performing cyclical inspections on your electrical and I&C systems, we carry out routine checks using our remote services technology to verify the condition of your plant in operation. The time-based maintenance service also includes maintenance management with Omnivise Asset Management.",
        "Product support for maximum profitability throughout the entire life cycle",
        "The ability to plan reliably for all power plant assets is vital in the face of ever tougher competition. The expected useful life of major mechanical items is generally greater than that of I&C systems, which are subject to shorter innovation cycles. Strategic lifetime support for I&C technology is thus essential if optimal use is to be made of the systems in place over the long term.",
        "A system manufacturer itself, Siemens Energy offers tailored long-term service and system maintenance contracts providing lifetime support for your I&C systems throughout the life of your plant so that you can permanently maximize your profitability. All long-term agreements are always individually matched to the relevant market situation and the specific remaining life of your plant.",
        "Our lifetime support for current I&C technology generations (Omnivise T3000 and SPPA-T2000) includes system maintenance contracts incorporating cyber security checks and enhancements, update information service, software updates and malware protection to provide assured long-term plant security and availability. ",
        "Today's I&C systems are ever more tightly integrated and often use standardized platforms from the IT sector. Given the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, it is very important to obtain a precise picture of the cyber security level of the plant and its I&C systems so that protective measures can be defined and implemented to remedy any deficiencies detected. Plant availability must be the top priority here.",
        "Trojans, spyware, viruses: the experience we have gained as the market leader from our hundreds of plants in operation puts us in the ideal position to tackle your security threats. We draw on this experience to develop cyber security solutions and assist you with all software and IT security measures over the entire lifetime of your power plant.",
        "Siemens Energy Security Analysis , for example, are a holistic, modular examination of potential security gaps based on established cyber security standards.",
        "Another important cyber security measure is malware protection, which helps to make certain that secure I&C systems stay that way. Updates are accordingly issued at defined intervals either for automated delivery via the Siemens Energy Remote Service Platform or for manual download via the Siemens Energy Customer Portal. The timing of updates is freely configurable.",
        "Our lifetime support for current I&C technology generations (Omnivise T3000 and SPPA- T2000) includes system maintenance contracts incorporating cyber security checks and enhancements, update information service, software updates and malware protection to provide assured long-term plant security and availability. ",
