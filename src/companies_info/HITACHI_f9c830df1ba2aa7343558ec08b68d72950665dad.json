        "Hitachi Energy's indoor and underground substations are compact solutions, designed to blend in with their surroundings, and almost unnoticeable to the general public. Our comprehensive experience and innovative technologies form the basis for customized solutions integrating all the relevant aspects, from safety and aesthetics through to space economy. Incorporating IEC 61850 substation automation systems enable local and remote control and monitoring of all power assets as well as enterprise-wide data integration for efficient power system management – i.e., the smart grid.",
