        "Controlled switching contributes to mitigating harmful electrical transients upon planned switching of capacitor banks, shunt reactors, power transformers, power cables, and transmission lines. The method is also gaining acceptance for re-energizing of EHV transmission lines, replacing traditional pre-insertion resistors. Since 1986, thousands of Switchsync controllers have been delivered all over the world.",
        "Switchsync PWC600 is Hitachi Energy's latest generation of point-on-wave controllers. Offering the full functionality and reliability of previous Switchsync products, it additionally includes Ethernet interfaces, which support modern communication protocols, and enhanced functionality and flexibility towards the user.",
        "Switchsync PWC600 is designed for single-pole operated circuit breakers, controlling each pole to close and/or open at the optimal point on the wave for the switched load, the circuit breaker, and power quality. It features unprecedented flexibility for switching various loads with diverse configurations, comprehensive monitoring functionality to track circuit breaker behavior, and handling multiple loads connected to the same breaker. For power transformers, PWC600 can estimate the residual fluxes in the core to minimize energization transients under all switching scenarios. For transmission lines, PWC600 can detect secondary arcs and predict the non-periodic gap voltage across the circuit breaker after a protection trip, to minimize switching overvoltages and prevent missing current zeros during auto-reclosing. It compensates for variations in environmental factors and drifts in circuit breaker properties. An intuitive configuration tool and local and web-based user interfaces facilitate easy access to the relevant functions. The product offers waveforms and operations recording facility with time & date stamping to assist in interpreting the controlled switching performance.",
        "Hitachi Energy's high-voltage circuit breakers are well suited for controlled switching, featuring consistent operating times and steep and stable dynamic dielectric withstand capability.\r\n ",
