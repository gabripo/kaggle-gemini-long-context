        "Flexible, scalable design for efficient energy storage.​",
        "Energy storage is critical to decarbonizing the power system and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It's also essential to build resilient, reliable, and affordable electricity grids that can handle the variable nature of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. There are different energy storage solutions available today, but lithium-ion batteries are currently the technology of choice due to their cost-effectiveness and high efficiency.​",
        "Battery Energy Storage Systems, or BESS, are rechargeable batteries that can store energy from different sources and discharge it when needed. BESS consist of one or more batteries and can be used to balance the electric grid, provide backup power and improve grid stability.​ ",
        "From renewable energy producers, conventional thermal power plant operators and grid operators to industrial electricity consumers, and offshore drilling platforms or vessels, BESS offer highly efficient and cost-effective energy storage solutions. With BESS, you can even generate new revenue streams as it allows energy arbitrage or directly reduce your electricity bill via peak shaving.",
        "Battery energy storage systems (BESS) from Siemens Energy are comprehensive and proven. Battery units, PCS skids, and battery management system software are all part of our BESS solutions, ensuring maximum efficiency and safety for each customer. You can count on us for parts, maintenance services, and remote operation support as your reliable service partner.",
        "Currently, Siemens Energy offers BlueVault™ Storage solution for the marine and offshore market and SIESTART for utilities and T&D network operators. For industrial deployment, we offer a customized battery storage solution to meet your unique business needs.",
        "Siemens Energy's BlueVault™ storage solutions promote on-demand renewable energy and increase the economics of fluctuating demand. They optimize on-site energy sources, capture peak loads, increase flexibility, and provide operating reserves for conventional power plants. The BlueWind solution improves offshore floating wind turbine performance while reducing emissions by enabling the shutdown of gas turbines on oil and gas facilities. ​",
