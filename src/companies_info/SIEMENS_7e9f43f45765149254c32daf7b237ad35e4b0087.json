        "The Siemens Energy SGT-300 gas turbine is a proven and reliable solution for power generation and combined heat and power applications. ",
        "With a single-shaft configuration providing an electrical power output of 7.9 MW and a twin-shaft version delivering a shaft output of 8.4 MW or 9.1 MW, the SGT-300 offers versatile power generation capabilities. ",
        "Its compact design, on-site maintainability, and inherent reliability, combined with the ability to operate with a wide range of gaseous and liquid fuels, make it an efficient and flexible choice for various applications.",
        "In cogeneration configuration, with its excellent efficiency and high steam-raising capability, the SGT-300 forms the core of reliable, efficient and powerful combined heat and power plants. For industrial cogeneration, the high steam-raising capability of more than 18 tonnes per hour contributes towards achieving overall plant efficiencies of 80% or higher.",
        "For compliance with stringent environmental legislation, the SGT-300 gas turbine is equipped with a Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system, providing low NOₓ emission levels with liquid and gaseous fuels. Emissions on gas fuel, corrected to 15% O₂ dry: NOₓ: < 10 ppmvd CO: < 10 ppmvd",
        "The SGT-300 operates on a wide range of gases, covering an extensive Wobbe fuel range. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 30 vol% of hydrogen (H2). It is also able to burn a large number of liquid fuels and offers dual-fuel capability. You will benefit from automatic changeover from primary to secondary fuel at any load.",
        "The SGT-300 can be maintained on-site. Furthermore, the option of rapid core turbine exchange will minimize the downtime of your gas turbine.",
        "You can use the SGT-300 for a wide variety of power generation applications, including:",
        "Typical mechanical drive applications are:",
        "The single-shaft SGT-300 consists of a single twin-bearing rotor with heavy-duty casing. Quick core engine exchange is possible, which significantly cuts your maintenance-related downtime.",
        "The SGT-300 twin-shaft has a 2-stage gas generator turbine and a 2-stage power turbine. The core turbine is designed for high reliability with powerful performance and quick load following. Its modular design approach allows turbine module exchanges to be carried out on-site as an alternative to a gas generator or power turbine service exchange.",
        "Both versions of the SGT-300 gas turbine are equipped with a Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion system, providing low NOₓ emission levels with liquid and gaseous fuels and dual-fuel capability.",
        "SGT-300 core engine: single-shaft version",
        "SGT-300 core engine: twin-shaft version",
        "The compact SGT-300 gas turbine packages for power generation and mechanical drive applications comprise factory-tested modules, and offer a high power-to-weight ratio. The packages  incorporate gas turbine, gearbox (where applicable), drive unit and all factory-tested fluid modules mounted on an underbase, which you can easily transport, install and maintain on-site.",
        "The shop-tested and certified fluid system modules are the same for design across the SGT-100 to SGT-400 range and come fully wired into the package control systems:",
        "The health and safety of the operation and maintenance staff are paramount. This is why our SGT-300 packages are designed with a special emphasis on, e.g., walkways and handrails, noise suppression, access doorways, and safety interlocks.",
        "The SGT-300 package for power generation is suitable for simple cycle, combined cycle and cogeneration.",
        "High steam-raising capability, compact arrangement, on-site maintainability, and an inherent reliability make it an ideal choice for many applications, including applications in the demanding oil and gas industry.",
        "The mechanical drive package is very compact, with a small footprint and a high power-to-weight ratio. The twin-shaft configuration offers excellent speed and load turndown characteristics to allow maximum flexibility of operation.",
        "With its excellent efficiency and steam-raising capability of more than 18 tonnes per hour, the SGT-300 forms the core of reliable, efficient and powerful combined heat and power plants (CHP). This contributes towards achieving overall plant efficiencies of 80% or higher.",
        "When compared with conventional energy supplies, a cogeneration plant based on the SGT-300 will provide electrical power, heating and/or cooling with the benefit of:",
        "The SGT-300-based CHP plant was required to help provide for the energy needs of 13,000 people living and studying at an university campus, in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The plant runs predominantly at part load, with various load adjustments, and provides trigeneration: heating, cooling, and electrical power.",
        "Our comprehensive portfolio of services provides low life cycle cost and optimum performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle: Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul service, field service, spare parts, service exchange, remote diagnostic service, and modernization and upgrades.",
        "Siemens specialists offer on-site support all over the world.",
        "The SGT-300 is designed for easy maintenance:",
        "The core engine maintenance can be performed on-site or off-site.",
        "The first stage rotor blades can be axially removed for quick and easy on-site exchange, maximizing availability.",
        "For minimized downtimes and maximized availability, the combustion chambers, flame tubes and ignitors are easily accessible for inspection.",
        "Multiple borescope ports are used to inspect the engine. They allow visual inspection of the interior of the engine without disassembly. The borescope inspections prevent unnecessary maintenance.",
        "The single-shaft SGT-300 operates on a wide range of gases, including gas fuels outside of standard pipeline quality. It covers a Wobbe fuel range from approximately 50 MJ/m³ down to 17.5 MJ/m³, which include, e.g., gas fuels available in LNG liquefaction plants, wellhead gas and minimally processed, weak wellhead gas, biogas from ethanol, industry waste, or landfill gas. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 30 vol% of hydrogen (H2).",
        "The SGT-300 is also able to burn a large number of liquid fuels and offers dual-fuel capability, with automatic changeover from primary to secondary fuel at any load.",
        "For high fuel flexibility, the SGT-300 uses a robust can annular combustion system with six reverse-flow tubular chambers, and a high energy igniter in each combustor.",
        "The SGT-300 DLE combustor burns a great variety of gaseous and liquid fuels and offers clean combustion with low emissions.",
        "The proven and reliable Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustor offers clean combustion with low emissions over a wide operating range.",
        "The SGT-300 uses six reverse-flow tubular combustion chambers positioned around a high-pressure casing. Each burner contains its own ignition source and is capable of gas-only, liquid-only or dual-fuel operation. Fuel is controlled by both a pilot and a main burner, with the control system providing for smooth changeover across the power range.",
        "With the DLE combustion system, emission compliance at lower operating loads down to 50% or lower is possible.",
        "The SGT-300 DLE combustion system provides NOₓ and CO emission compliance with the most stringent environmental legislations.",
        "NOₓ emission increases exponentially with temperature. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that air and fuel are optimally mixed. The Siemens DLE combustion system achieves low emissions over a wide load range by a lean air/fuel premix flame with multiple fuel-injection points.",
