        "The definition of contingency transformers and reactors may vary across customers, manufacturers, and even from one part of the world to another.",
        "These units are designed to bring rapid responses, improve power quality, or provide temporary power where and when it‚Äôs needed all across the globe.",
        "They are used during the following:",
        "‚Ä¢ Planned maintenance\r\n‚Ä¢ Temporary substation capacity increase\r\n‚Ä¢ Forced outage repairs\r\n‚Ä¢ Weather and other natural outages\r\n‚Ä¢ Sabotage and attacks\r\n‚Ä¢ Spare or backup solutions",
        "Besides mobility, these units offer service providers time to make repairs and get service back on without interruption. For example, the mobile substation is useful when maintenance work is needed on substations. This keeps the consumer's power from being shut off during repairs. Their compact size also makes the units easier to use in small areas. Their flexibility allows them to be switched from one task to another relatively easily.",
        "Standard ‚ö´ Optional ‚ö™ Not Applicable¬†üö´\r\n¬†",
        "Mobile Transformers are fast-recovery, multi-voltage units that are available with Hitachi Energy‚Äôs ‚Äúshell-type‚Äù technology that uses a patented unique configuration of the transformer‚Äôs active components. It enables an ultra-compact and durable solution ideal for emergencies and quick transport.",
        "These power transformers are often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Mobile Transformers are factory-built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil-filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours and can be detached from their moving base for extended or specific operations.",
        "Mobile Transformers can cover a broad range of emergency response scenarios. When installed on a trailer, the transformer can be shipped to different locations within 230kV and 345kV.",
        "Mobile Transformer 2 design options:\nSame physics and functionality but different construction.",
        "These transformers are part of a mobile substation, including switchgear, breakers, control, and protection circuits. This mobile power station can be on location within 24 hours and provide temporary electrical power to the downed area. The units are designed for outdoor use, some having a long-life, durable coating. Their most significant advantage is the ability to move from one location to another quickly.",
        "Similar to our Mobile Transformer products, a Mobile Shunt Reactor is often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Since a shunt reactor is an absorber of reactive power, it will increase the energy efficiency of the system by also being the most compact device commonly used for reactive power compensation in long high-voltage transmission lines, which makes them ideally suited for mobile applications.",
        "Mobile Shunt Reactors are factory built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours, and they can also be detached from their moving base (semi-trailer, box truck, or sea-freight container) for operations.",
