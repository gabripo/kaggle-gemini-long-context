        "Safety and efficiency have top priority for us when it comes to automating the operation of vessels. Thanks to state-of-the-art support standards, our integrated solutions for ship automation facilitate the continuous monitoring and reliable control of all relevant onboard processes. They open up new optimization potentials and help you optimize the complex operating process of vessels. Thanks to a standardized concept for the automation and operation of all technical processes, potential fault sources are eliminated. Simplified system overviews, including subsystems, provide the crew with a sound basis for decision-making under all circumstances.",
        "We offer state-of-the-art automation and control technology that assists crews in tackling ever more complex technical processes on board – and for almost any kind of vessel.",

        "As a ship owner or ship operator, you rely on numerous software and hardware systems to answer ever more complex challenges in your daily business. With SISHIP EcoMAIN, you can use data from any number of systems on board in a uniform platform to make better decisions and save costs.",
        "SISHIP EcoMAIN assists you with ship management decisions by providing operating data from all relevant onboard systems and equipment on a joint data platform that can also be accessed onshore. This allows you to compare important operating parameters across an entire fleet, and to identify and implement best practices that will significantly reduce your costs.",
        "Energy consumption, emissions, bunkering fluids, service schedules, documentation and information management – these are just some of the processes that are typically evaluated and analyzed for optimization. The primary optimization potentials lie in the areas of energy efficiency, environmental compatibility, and maintenance support. SISHIP EcoMAIN lays the foundation for efficient ship management on board and for green fleet management, which permanently ensures and improves the competitiveness of your fleet.",
        "Your advantages with SISHIP EcoMAIN",
        "The powerful and reliable SISHIP IMAC control system assumes all alarm, monitoring, and control functions. Its particular strengths are demonstrated in its ability to be scalable and to process a high number of measuring points. SISHIP IMAC communicates with other automation systems on board and enables the integration of complex systems such as the propulsion control system or the power management system.",
        "The integrated monitoring, alarm, and control system SISHIP IMAC has been developed to meet the highest requirements in terms of operability, safety, and reliability. As a monitoring system, SISHIP IMAC allows clear visualization and seamless monitoring of a large number of fully automated processes running in parallel on ships of all types and sizes. As a control system, SISHIP IMAC allows efficient controlling of these processes; it is self-monitoring and offers the highest safety standards using the most advanced technologies.",
        "Your advantages with SISHIP IMAC",
        "With every technological advance, machinery and processes become more complex, requiring automation systems even for routine tasks. Therefore, periodic onshore and offshore training supports your crew in preserving the highest levels of security and efficiency by maintaining a comprehensive understanding of real-life situations and matching them with their representation in the automation systems.",
        "The OBTS and LBTS training systems teach your crew how to fully exploit the potential of onboard automation solutions. OBTS and LBTS provide training in operational situations under realistic conditions on the actual automation software – either as onboard training in regular operation, by switching between operating and training modes (OBTS), or as land-based training at special training centers (LBTS). The hands-on trainings simulate physical processes and system behavior with mathematical models and the same automation software and HMI that the crew uses on board.",
        "Your advantages with OBTS and LBTS",
        "A submarine is a highly complex system comprising a variety of subsystems. Among other things, the trim, regulation, pressure, and ventilation systems must be controlled and monitored. To simplify operation and further support the operator, all systems are controlled and monitored using one central system.",
        "The engineering, monitoring, and control system EMCS has been developed to ensure efficient and safe operation of all vital subsystems of submarines. EMCS combines all onboard subsystems of a submarine in a central, highly functional solution and creates the process transparency required for fast and profound decisions. It shares the operation, control, and monitoring of all subsystems with central and local user terminals and displays all process data in real time on the monitor, affording the crew an excellent overview. To guarantee maximum safety, plausibility checks on the crew’s inputs are carried out automatically before execution. The system factors into the verification the submarine’s prevailing operating mode, e.g. surface navigation, underwater navigation, or silent running. In addition, the continuous monitoring of hardware and software is conducted by a wide spectrum of integrated test functions.",
        "Your advantages with EMCS",
        "Automation solutions on board navy surface vessels must safeguard the ship and crew in any operating situation, therefore unconditional system availability is just as important as excellent reliability and straightforward operation. IPMS ensures that operations run smoothly and that system failures do not turn into a catastrophe.",
        "Unconditional system availability is one of the primary requirements of an integrated automation system for naval surface vessels, especially when it comes to reliability of the onboard power supply. IPMS, Siemens Energy’s integrated automation system for naval surface vessels, features redundant monitoring and control of the propulsion system and other onboard subsystems. Thus, IPMS guarantees the mission-critical functionality of all onboard electrical systems, even in emergency situations.",
        "The system monitors and controls all the power modules, from the diesel engine and gas turbine to the transmission and pumps right through to the exhaust system, including ancillary modules such as fuel supply, ventilation, and fire alarm systems. Its integrated energy management capability ensures reliable power supply and energy distribution in every situation.",
        "Your advantages with IPMS",
        "If you want to learn more about our offering for the marine sectors, don’t hesitate to contact us. Our marine experts will gladly answer all your questions and provide you with comprehensive information.",
