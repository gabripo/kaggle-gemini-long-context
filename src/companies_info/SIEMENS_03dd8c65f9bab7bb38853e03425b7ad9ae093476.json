        "Innovative mix of proven design concepts with air-pressurized cooling technology for flexible operation",
        "Our latest product innovation, the SGen-2000P series, combines air cooling with water cooling technology. Pressurized air-cooled generators are replacing indirectly hydrogen-cooled machines to significantly reduce plant complexity. They achieve efficiency and power levels comparable to indirectly hydrogen-cooled generators with ratings of up to 560 MVA. Pressurized air-cooled generators are used in simple cycle, combined cycle, and steam power plants, as well as in synchronous condensing applications.",
        "Combining GVPI stators with water cooling technology enables uniform temperatures and low stress levels to enhance operational flexibility. The proven reliability is greater than 99.9% for more than 1,700 stator windings between 10 and 22 kV with an output of up to 650 MVA. Our fleet leader has over 150,000 operating hours and 3,320 start/stop cycles.",
        "Modern grids require high operational flexibility because of the increased integration of renewable energy sources. Our design supports high ramp-up/down rates and frequent start/stop cycles while keeping thermal mechanical stress in the stator windings low.",
        "Our proven MICALASTIC® insulation system and Global Vacuum Pressure Impregnation (GVPI) technology ensure maximum electrical endurance and outstanding availability.  ",
        "The absence of hydrogen gas reduces the complexity of auxiliaries as well as the cost of service and operation. There is no need for hazardous operational areas around the generator. Arriving almost fully assembled, the generator is designed for easy on-site installation and includes many provisions for accessible maintenance. ",
        "Our generators maintain a high level of common parts across the portfolio (e.g. stator core assembly and rotor). The part and component re-use improves the availability of spare parts and increases the quality in manufacturing and assembling components from our suppliers, at our factory, as well as on site.",
        "The SGen-2000P generator offers an innovative mix of verified design features in operating ranges typically reserved for hydrogen-cooled generators. The water-cooled stator and air pressurization system allow this series of generators to operate within an extended performance range and with maximum load-shift flexibility.",
        "Depending on load demand, the generator is automatically pressurized up to 1 bar (gauge) to control rotor temperature within industry standards.",
        "Water-cooled stator bars minimize thermal-mechanical stresses in the end winding allowing for unlimited operational flexibility across the design power range.",
        "The SGen-2000P implements technology featuring the latest verified design with more than 1,700 GVPI stators in operation across all operating ranges and a fleet-leading water-cooled GVPI stator with over 151,000 hours of operation and more than 3,320 start/stop cycles with no indication of thermal-mechanical stress-related issues. Without the application of hydrogen, the SGen-2000P series offers you the added benefit of unstaffed operation, e.g. for synchronous condenser applications.",
        "Our patented MICALASTIC® insulation system using GVPI is highly resistant to mechanical and thermal stresses while featuring excellent electrical properties.",
        "Our patent-pending load-dependent air pressurization system enables rotor cooling during flexible operating conditions.",
        "The SGen-2000P generator series was designed for simplified service and maintenance. Along with eliminating hydrogen-related generator auxiliaries, various service-friendly design solutions have been implemented. Its components have been tried and tested over decades of operation, achieving a reliability rate of more than 99.9%. To minimize downtime, the maintenance intervals have been aligned with those of the prime mover and now allow for longer intervals between servicing than ever before. The rotor is designed for lifetime operation without removal for service.",
        "Our generators arrive on site almost fully assembled with the rotor installed – a design feature that simplifies the installation process. Our certified engineers have extensive experience in commissioning and help you to achieve faster start-up times and smooth operation. The SGen-2000P is designed for easy access. The many manholes installed allow for the majority of maintenance to be completed requiring very little generator disassembly.",
        "Besides standard inspection scopes and intervals, you also have the option of implementing a condition-based maintenance plan using customized installed instrumentation, component analytics, and a remaining life counter for better predictions. Based on advanced data analytics performed by experts in our network of power diagnostics centers, we can advise you on a maintenance schedule according to your specific operation conditions and needs.",
        "Our reliable and robust generator is the result of our manufacturing and engineering design teams working in close collaboration throughout its development. By applying the latest digital technologies, our manufacturing facilities stepped up to create a world-class product for you with excellent lead times.",
        "Our SGen-2000P generator design focuses on the strengths of our manufacturing facilities using tried-and-tested manufacturing processes and newly co-developed processes to efficiently build generators for you.",
        "Our manufacturing facilities implement as many automated processes as possible, resulting in a high ratio of repetition in the construction of our generators. Automated processes are key to building high-quality, robust generators that operate reliably for you.",
        "Our SGen-2000P series combines two proven technologies in one innovative concept. The generator operates with air up to 560 MVA and features variable pressurization with water-cooled stator windings. This enables the flexible operation demanded by today's evolving electrical grids. By eliminating hydrogen gas auxiliary systems, the SGen-2000P series' operating and maintenance costs are lower than those of traditional hydrogen-cooled products in this output class.",
        "Directly water-cooled stator bars protect against thermal-mechanical stress-related issues that are challenging for indirectly cooled coils in a highly cyclic environment.",
        "The SGen-2000P eliminates all hydrogen-related systems – seal oil, hydrogen and inert gas systems – maintaining only a pressurized air skid and a stator water system. Thereby, the hazardous system requirements that applied to the use of hydrogen are avoided – another huge benefit for our customers.",
        "Flexible gas and steam power plants will remain a key component of a demand-driven power supply. They form the solid foundation of a diverse and clean energy mix – indispensable for meeting the world's current and future challenges. Our pressurized air-cooled generators complement the turbine packages of any manufacturer and meet grid and environmental requirements as well as your individual needs.",
        "Our generators can be flexibly integrated into combined cycle power plants or steam tailing applications.",
        "We supply generators for large simple or combined cycle power plants, suitable for peak, intermediate or base load duty, as well as cogeneration applications.",
        "Rotating synchronous condensers are a proven, reliable solution for ancillary grid services guaranteeing frequency and voltage stability, plus the ability to ride through grid disturbances. Today’s emerging power systems are dominated by converter connected renewable power producers which are susceptible to decreased short circuit power and system inertia, making them more sensitive to electrical faults and sudden load imbalances. Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues.",
        "Synchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid.",
        "A synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events.",
