For example:\n\nTechnical and Commercial Tender Agents: Separate prompts (tender_prompt_template_technical and tender_prompt_template_commercial) are used to guide the technical tender engineer and the commercial tender manager roles, respectively. Each agent has distinct objectives: identifying and summarizing technical or commercial requirements within tenders. This multi-agent structure ensures detailed and domain-specific analyses.\n\nA distinct prompt is also prepared for analyzing companies (e.g., SIEMENS and HITACHI) to match tender requirements with their products and solutions (get_response_companies_info). This allows tailored reasoning for comparing affinity between tenders and company offerings.\n\n## Chain of Thoughts\nThe chain of thoughts approach is used to decompose complex tasks into sequential, step-by-step actions, ensuring methodical problem-solving. \nIn both technical and commercial prompts we used phrases like \"Think step by step\" to guide the agent toward incremental reasoning. This ensures that requirements are dissected and analyzed in detail.\nThe user prompt specifies a structured approach to calculating an affinity score, prompting the agent to explicitly explain the calculation process.\nFinally in the Clause-by-Clause Analysis, the final prompt directs the agent to meticulously compare tender requirements with company specifications, maintaining a clear progression in thought.\nThis approach is embedded in the query processing of tenders and the affinity scoring logic in user_prompt_match and final_prompt, encouraging logical progression in the analysis.\n\n## In-chat memory\nThe code utilizes in-chat memory to maintain conversational context across multiple interactions. This functionality is facilitated by Chat History Preservation: The function add_history_to_chat appends user queries and model responses (e.g., for tenders or company analyses) to history_chat. This ensures continuity, enabling the model to refer back to previous inputs and outputs during subsequent exchanges.\nAdditionally, prompts such as system_prompt and user_prompt leverage the accumulated chat history to enhance the depth and relevance of responses. For example, when computing affinity scores or performing a clause-by-clause analysis, the model can reference earlier content in the chat_with_memory object. This allows a continous improvement of the prompt and on the information stored in the chat.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion for use case\nUsing a long context window instead of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the selected use case was particularly beneficial due to the nature of the task, which involves reasoning across interdependent documents, maintaining conversational continuity, and ensuring consistent context for decision-making. \nIn fact, in the past, we implemented a multi-agent framework using LangChain and OpenAI, where each company was represented by a dedicated agent. The repo is publicily availbla at https://github.com/SecchiAlessandro/LumadaAI. This framework was designed with a supervisor agent that dynamically routed user queries to the most relevant company-specific agent based on the query context. While innovative for that time, this approach encountered several challenges, particularly in stability, accuracy, and efficiency, making the current solution implemented in the notebook a more effective alternative. \nAs the agents are operating independently, it was also difficult to generate combined solutions from different companies.\nMoreover, for each query, the supervisor had to perform an additional step of reasoning before invoking an agent.\nIf the query was relevant to multiple agents, the framework had to perform multiple sequential calls, compounding the latency.\n\nThe current solution with a centralized reasoning, ensure consistent application of logic and context.\nBy avoiding the intermediate step of agent selection, it directly processes queries with a unified context, significantly reducing latency.\n\nThe unified context allows the model to cross-reference tender requirements and company offerings directly, ensuring a cohesive and accurate analysis.\nThis is particularly advantageous for tasks like affinity scoring, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple data points.\n\nThe notebook’s approach scales better for handling multiple queries simultaneously, as it avoids the bottleneck of sequential agent calls. In fact, for new tender projects, it is just required to update the in-chat memory and to add new prompts for adding new in-chat agents.\n\n\nIn summary, why we decided to implement tender2project?\n\n1. Holistic Context Retention\nLong Context Window: By storing the entire history of tender analyses (both technical and commercial) and company product evaluations, the model retains a comprehensive understanding of all previously provided information. This holistic context allows the model to reason about how specific requirements and offerings interrelate across multiple prompts.\nIn RAG, the system retrieves only the most relevant chunks of information from the documents for each query. While efficient, this approach can fragment the analysis when tasks require synthesizing insights across documents, potentially leading to overlooked interconnections.\n2. Interdependent Analysis\nTender and Company Matching: The task involves comparing multiple tenders against products and solutions offered by different companies, followed by calculating an affinity score and conducting a clause-by-clause compliance analysis. These steps require information from previous steps to be accessible and integrated seamlessly.\nRAG typically retrieves context independently for each query, which might result in loss of nuance or context-dependent reasoning, especially when relationships between multiple documents must be preserved. A long context window ensures the model has immediate access to the entire conversational flow and insights developed so far.\n3. Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration\nRole-Based Prompts: By maintaining a long context, the system can simulate multi-agent collaboration, where outputs from technical engineers, commercial managers, and sales managers flow into a unified reasoning framework.\nIn RAG, each role’s analysis would require re-retrieving relevant information from documents, potentially leading to inconsistencies or duplications. With a long context window, outputs from one role naturally inform others, creating a seamless chain of thought.\n4. Reduced Query Overhead\nFewer Retrievals, Continuous Focus: Long context windows reduce the need for multiple retrieval calls, making the process more efficient in scenarios where information is revisited or refined iteratively.\nRAG introduces latency and computational costs because each query requires searching and ranking document chunks. A long context window allows for continuous focus on the task, with all prior exchanges readily available.\n5. Affinity Score Calculation\nGlobal Context for Consistent Metrics: Computing an affinity score across companies for tenders requires integrating technical and commercial analysis alongside company data. This step benefits significantly from the model’s ability to access all previous responses simultaneously.\nIn RAG, affinity scoring would require separate retrievals of technical requirements, commercial requirements, and company data for each tender. This could introduce discrepancies if context for one query is inadvertently excluded during retrieval.\n6. Clause-by-Clause Compliance Analysis\nIntegrated Insight Application: Clause-by-clause analysis relies on cross-referencing previously extracted requirements with company offerings. The long context window allows the model to directly reference earlier inputs and outputs without reloading or retrieving.\nRAG retrievals for clause-by-clause analysis might lead to inconsistencies if prior reasoning is split across multiple retrievals. A long context window ensures the model \"remembers\" and applies earlier analyses cohesively.\nTrade-offs and Use Case Fit\n\n## Conclusion\nThe centralized, long context window approach provides clear advantages in stability, response time, and accuracy over the earlier multi-agent framework. It highlights the importance of selecting a system architecture that aligns with the specific demands of the use case, particularly for complex, multi-faceted analyses like those in tender evaluations, clause-by-clause generation and company affinity scoring.\n#### The long context window acts as a shared workspace, recording and making all agent outputs accessible for seamless and holistic reasoning. In today's interconnected world, where partnerships and synergies are essential to addressing complex challenges, we envision a tool that enables continuous reasoning, uncovers new patterns and solutions, and minimizes the fragmentation of insights.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import Python libraries\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.510931Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.511247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.522227Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.511209Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.521224Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary function to read JSON files\ndef read_json_info(jsonFilePath: str) -> dict:\n    if os.path.exists(jsonFilePath):\n        with open(jsonFilePath, \"r\") as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n        return data\n    else:\n        return {}","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.523363Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.523692Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.533071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.523655Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T12:49:32.532210Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary Python decorator to execute a function again, if its execution fails\n# this is helpful when calling the Gemini's API since Gemini has a rate limiter and, if an execution fails for that, there will be some waiting time before retrying\nimport time\n\ndef retry_on_failure(wait_time_seconds=60, max_retries=5):\n    def decorator_retry(func):\n        \n        def wrapper_retry(*args, **kwargs):\n            retries = 0\n            while retries < max_retries:\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    retries += 1\n                    if retries < max_retries:\n                        print(\n                            f\"Function failed with error: {e}.

RelCare is suitable to ensure a sustainable and safe energy supply and help to extend the asset's lifetime.\n\n\n* **Training:**  Hitachi Energy offers training packages that can meet the tender's requirements for personnel training.\n\n\n## 2. Affinity Score Calculation:\n\nTo compute an affinity score, I'll use a simplified approach.  This involves:\n\n1. **Identifying Key Requirements:** The key requirements of the tender are power generation equipment (diesel genset, solar PV system, battery storage), grid infrastructure (substation, MV/LV network), monitoring system, after-sales service, and training.\n\n2. **Assessing Company Alignment:** For each company, I will count how many of the key requirements they directly address with their product and service offerings.\n\n3. **Calculating the Affinity Score:** The affinity score is calculated as (Number of key requirements met / Total number of key requirements) * 100%.\n\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's assume the following (this could be refined with a more detailed tender analysis):\n\n| Key Requirement                     | Siemens Met? | Hitachi Met? |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Power Generation Equipment           | Yes           | Yes           |\n| Grid Infrastructure                 | Yes           | Yes           |\n| Monitoring System                    | Yes           | Yes           |\n| After-Sales Service                 | Yes           | Yes           |\n| Training                             | Yes           | Yes           |\n| **Total Key Requirements Met**       | **5**         | **5**         |\n\n\n**Affinity Scores:**\n\n* **Siemens Energy:** (5/5) * 100% = 100%\n* **Hitachi Energy:** (5/5) * 100% = 100%\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBoth companies, based on the information provided, appear to offer solutions that directly address all the identified key requirements of the tender.  Therefore, both receive a 100% affinity score.  However, this is a simplified assessment. A more thorough analysis might consider the specific features offered within each solution, their suitability for the project context, and the overall commercial competitiveness of their bids (price, warranty, etc.)  Such factors could modify the affinity scores, even if they both meet all requirements.  For example, if Siemens offered a more cost-effective solution for a specific high-value component, that could slightly tilt the score in their favor.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_match, 'answer': response_match.text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T12:55:14.904951Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T12:55:14.905293Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T12:55:14.910273Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T12:55:14.905266Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T12:55:14.909289Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generate the clause-by-clause","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"user_prompt = \"\"\"\n\nConsider the company with the highest affinity score \nand return the clause by clause analysis considering technical and commercial compliant and not-compliant requirements\nof the tender with respect to the selected company.

bid. Siemens Energy must provide a detailed pricing breakdown for all items and services, including:\n\n* Equipment costs for all components.\n* Installation labor costs.\n* Transportation costs.\n* Warranty costs.\n* Manual production costs.\n* Spare parts costs (including a detailed spare parts list).\n* Training costs.\n* After-sales service costs (including a detailed breakdown of service levels).\n* Contingency planning and risk mitigation costs.\n\nA competitive pricing strategy, reflecting market conditions and the value proposition of Siemens Energy’s solutions, is paramount for winning the tender.  Clearly articulating payment terms and timelines will also be essential.\n\n\nThis clause-by-clause analysis shows that while Siemens Energy possesses the technological capabilities to meet most of the tender's technical requirements, a comprehensive commercial proposal is necessary to demonstrate full compliance and win the contract.  Further details on specific product models and pricing are essential for a complete evaluation.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_clause_by_clause, 'answer': response_clause_by_clause.text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T13:05:36.376677Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T13:05:36.377069Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T13:05:36.381720Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T13:05:36.377035Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T13:05:36.380739Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Count the overall tokens","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The total number of token can be computed by counting the tokens of history_chat, since the new responses have been appended to it for each call of Gemini.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"{model.count_tokens(history_chat)=}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T13:06:12.765435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T13:06:12.766046Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T13:06:22.141361Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T13:06:12.766011Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T13:06:22.140392Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"model.count_tokens(history_chat)=total_tokens: 667915\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27}]}
