For example:\n\nTechnical and Commercial Tender Agents: Separate prompts (tender_prompt_template_technical and tender_prompt_template_commercial) are used to guide the technical tender engineer and the commercial tender manager roles, respectively. Each agent has distinct objectives: identifying and summarizing technical or commercial requirements within tenders. This multi-agent structure ensures detailed and domain-specific analyses.\n\nA distinct prompt is also prepared for analyzing companies (e.g., SIEMENS and HITACHI) to match tender requirements with their products and solutions (get_response_companies_info). This allows tailored reasoning for comparing affinity between tenders and company offerings.\n\n## Chain of Thoughts\nThe chain of thoughts approach is used to decompose complex tasks into sequential, step-by-step actions, ensuring methodical problem-solving. \nIn both technical and commercial prompts we used phrases like \"Think step by step\" to guide the agent toward incremental reasoning. This ensures that requirements are dissected and analyzed in detail.\nThe user prompt specifies a structured approach to calculating an affinity score, prompting the agent to explicitly explain the calculation process.\nFinally in the Clause-by-Clause Analysis, the final prompt directs the agent to meticulously compare tender requirements with company specifications, maintaining a clear progression in thought.\nThis approach is embedded in the query processing of tenders and the affinity scoring logic in user_prompt_match and final_prompt, encouraging logical progression in the analysis.\n\n## In-chat memory\nThe code utilizes in-chat memory to maintain conversational context across multiple interactions. This functionality is facilitated by Chat History Preservation: The function add_history_to_chat appends user queries and model responses (e.g., for tenders or company analyses) to history_chat. This ensures continuity, enabling the model to refer back to previous inputs and outputs during subsequent exchanges.\nAdditionally, prompts such as system_prompt and user_prompt leverage the accumulated chat history to enhance the depth and relevance of responses. For example, when computing affinity scores or performing a clause-by-clause analysis, the model can reference earlier content in the chat_with_memory object. This allows a continous improvement of the prompt and on the information stored in the chat.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion for use case\nUsing a long context window instead of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the selected use case was particularly beneficial due to the nature of the task, which involves reasoning across interdependent documents, maintaining conversational continuity, and ensuring consistent context for decision-making. \nIn fact, in the past, we implemented a multi-agent framework using LangChain and OpenAI, where each company was represented by a dedicated agent. The repo is publicily availbla at https://github.com/SecchiAlessandro/LumadaAI. This framework was designed with a supervisor agent that dynamically routed user queries to the most relevant company-specific agent based on the query context. While innovative for that time, this approach encountered several challenges, particularly in stability, accuracy, and efficiency, making the current solution implemented in the notebook a more effective alternative. \nAs the agents are operating independently, it was also difficult to generate combined solutions from different companies.\nMoreover, for each query, the supervisor had to perform an additional step of reasoning before invoking an agent.\nIf the query was relevant to multiple agents, the framework had to perform multiple sequential calls, compounding the latency.\n\nThe current solution with a centralized reasoning, ensure consistent application of logic and context.\nBy avoiding the intermediate step of agent selection, it directly processes queries with a unified context, significantly reducing latency.\n\nThe unified context allows the model to cross-reference tender requirements and company offerings directly, ensuring a cohesive and accurate analysis.\nThis is particularly advantageous for tasks like affinity scoring, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple data points.\n\nThe notebook’s approach scales better for handling multiple queries simultaneously, as it avoids the bottleneck of sequential agent calls. In fact, for new tender projects, it is just required to update the in-chat memory and to add new prompts for adding new in-chat agents.\n\n\nIn summary, why we decided to implement tender2project?\n\n1. Holistic Context Retention\nLong Context Window: By storing the entire history of tender analyses (both technical and commercial) and company product evaluations, the model retains a comprehensive understanding of all previously provided information. This holistic context allows the model to reason about how specific requirements and offerings interrelate across multiple prompts.\nIn RAG, the system retrieves only the most relevant chunks of information from the documents for each query. While efficient, this approach can fragment the analysis when tasks require synthesizing insights across documents, potentially leading to overlooked interconnections.\n2. Interdependent Analysis\nTender and Company Matching: The task involves comparing multiple tenders against products and solutions offered by different companies, followed by calculating an affinity score and conducting a clause-by-clause compliance analysis. These steps require information from previous steps to be accessible and integrated seamlessly.\nRAG typically retrieves context independently for each query, which might result in loss of nuance or context-dependent reasoning, especially when relationships between multiple documents must be preserved. A long context window ensures the model has immediate access to the entire conversational flow and insights developed so far.\n3. Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration\nRole-Based Prompts: By maintaining a long context, the system can simulate multi-agent collaboration, where outputs from technical engineers, commercial managers, and sales managers flow into a unified reasoning framework.\nIn RAG, each role’s analysis would require re-retrieving relevant information from documents, potentially leading to inconsistencies or duplications. With a long context window, outputs from one role naturally inform others, creating a seamless chain of thought.\n4. Reduced Query Overhead\nFewer Retrievals, Continuous Focus: Long context windows reduce the need for multiple retrieval calls, making the process more efficient in scenarios where information is revisited or refined iteratively.\nRAG introduces latency and computational costs because each query requires searching and ranking document chunks. A long context window allows for continuous focus on the task, with all prior exchanges readily available.\n5. Affinity Score Calculation\nGlobal Context for Consistent Metrics: Computing an affinity score across companies for tenders requires integrating technical and commercial analysis alongside company data. This step benefits significantly from the model’s ability to access all previous responses simultaneously.\nIn RAG, affinity scoring would require separate retrievals of technical requirements, commercial requirements, and company data for each tender. This could introduce discrepancies if context for one query is inadvertently excluded during retrieval.\n6. Clause-by-Clause Compliance Analysis\nIntegrated Insight Application: Clause-by-clause analysis relies on cross-referencing previously extracted requirements with company offerings. The long context window allows the model to directly reference earlier inputs and outputs without reloading or retrieving.\nRAG retrievals for clause-by-clause analysis might lead to inconsistencies if prior reasoning is split across multiple retrievals. A long context window ensures the model \"remembers\" and applies earlier analyses cohesively.\nTrade-offs and Use Case Fit\n\n## Conclusion\nThe centralized, long context window approach provides clear advantages in stability, response time, and accuracy over the earlier multi-agent framework. It highlights the importance of selecting a system architecture that aligns with the specific demands of the use case, particularly for complex, multi-faceted analyses like those in tender evaluations, clause-by-clause generation and company affinity scoring.\n#### The long context window acts as a shared workspace, recording and making all agent outputs accessible for seamless and holistic reasoning. In today's interconnected world, where partnerships and synergies are essential to addressing complex challenges, we envision a tool that enables continuous reasoning, uncovers new patterns and solutions, and minimizes the fragmentation of insights.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import Python libraries\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.403605Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.404006Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.437153Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.403958Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.436011Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary function to read JSON files\ndef read_json_info(jsonFilePath: str) -> dict:\n    if os.path.exists(jsonFilePath):\n        with open(jsonFilePath, \"r\") as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n        return data\n    else:\n        return {}","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.439502Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.439973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.447314Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.439922Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T21:49:00.445950Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary Python decorator to execute a function again, if its execution fails\n# this is helpful when calling the Gemini's API since Gemini has a rate limiter and, if an execution fails for that, there will be some waiting time before retrying\nimport time\n\ndef retry_on_failure(wait_time_seconds=60, max_retries=5):\n    def decorator_retry(func):\n        \n        def wrapper_retry(*args, **kwargs):\n            retries = 0\n            while retries < max_retries:\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    retries += 1\n                    if retries < max_retries:\n                        print(\n                            f\"Function failed with error: {e}.

Relevant Siemens and Hitachi Products & Solutions for the Solar Tender\n\nThis analysis matches Siemens and Hitachi's product offerings to the requirements outlined in the solar tender document.  Remember that the tender has both technical and commercial requirements, and a successful bid will need to address both aspects.\n\n\n**A. Siemens Energy:**\n\nThe tender requires a wide range of equipment and services. Siemens Energy possesses a strong portfolio to meet these demands:\n\n* **Power Generation:** SGT-400, SGT-5000F, SGT-8000H, SGT-5-9000HL (depending on required power output) for the main power generation.  The SGT-5-4000F is mentioned specifically in the GT Auto Tuner section, indicating applicability.\n\n* **Energy Storage:**  Batteries (various Lithium-ion options meeting the 400kWh requirement) would satisfy the energy storage requirements.  The diesel genset is also addressed in the product offerings.\n\n* **Electrical BOS:**  Siemens' comprehensive offering in cables, junction boxes, and related components meets these requirements.  \n\n* **Monitoring System:**  The Omnivise Asset Management suite and its modular applications (including Omnivise Diagnostics, Maintenance, and Reliability) cover the SCADA requirements.\n\n* **Mini-Grid Infrastructure:**  Siemens offers transformers, cables (MV and LV), and related equipment for the mini-grid infrastructure.\n\n* **After-Sales Service:**  Siemens' extensive lifecycle services cover the 3-year after-sales service requirement.\n\n* **Software:** Omnivise T3000  and GT Auto Tuner addresses the requirements for the control system and optimization.\n\n\n**B. Hitachi Energy:**\n\nHitachi Energy also offers a compelling range of products relevant to the tender:\n\n* **Power Generation:** While specific gas turbine models aren't explicitly listed in the provided text, Hitachi Energy likely offers suitable gas turbines within the required power range.\n\n* **Energy Storage:**  Hitachi Energy's battery energy storage solutions (BESS) could satisfy the 400 kWh requirement.\n\n* **Electrical BOS:**  Similar to Siemens, Hitachi's offerings of cables, junction boxes, transformers and switchgears likely cover these aspects.\n\n* **Monitoring System:**  While not explicitly stated, Hitachi Energy offers monitoring systems for transformers and other equipment; the TXpert™ ecosystem likely offers a solution comparable to Siemens' Omnivise.\n\n* **Mini-Grid Infrastructure:** Hitachi offers transformers, switchgear, cables, and other equipment for mini-grid construction.\n\n* **After-Sales Service:**  Hitachi Energy's service agreements and maintenance programs are tailored to customer needs and likely cover the 3-year requirement.\n\n* **Software:**  nMarket for I-SEM (energy market participation software), while not directly related to the solar plant's operations, would be applicable to an independent power producer (IPP) participating in a power market.\n\n\n## 2. Affinity Score Calculation\n\nCalculating a precise affinity score requires a more detailed specification comparison and weighing of different criteria (e.g., technical compliance, price competitiveness, service capabilities, experience).  However, we can create a simplified affinity score based on the information provided.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Requirements:**  The tender has several key requirements:  Power generation, energy storage, electrical BOS, monitoring system, mini-grid infrastructure, and after-sales service.\n\n\n2. **Direct Product Match:** Assign a score of 1 (present) or 0 (absent) for each company for each key requirement based on the directly mentioned products that meet the need from the extracted information.\n\n3. **Weighted Average:** Calculate a weighted average for each company.  Since all key requirements have equal importance, we assign equal weight of 1 to each.\n\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n| Requirement             | Siemens Score | Hitachi Score | Weight | Siemens Weighted Score | Hitachi Weighted Score |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Power Generation         | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| Energy Storage           | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| Electrical BOS           | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| Monitoring System       | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| Mini-Grid Infrastructure | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| After-Sales Service     | 1             | 1             | 1      | 1                       | 1                       |\n| **Total Weighted Score** | **6**         | **6**         |        | **6**                   | **6**                   |\n\n**Affinity Score:**\n\n* **Siemens Affinity Score:** (6 / 6) * 100% = 100%\n* **Hitachi Affinity Score:** (6 / 6) * 100% = 100%\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBased on this simplified analysis, both Siemens and Hitachi have a 100% affinity score.  This does *not* imply that both companies are equally likely to win the tender. This is only based on directly available information and does not account for factors such as pricing, specific product specifications, project references, and the evaluation criteria used by the tendering authority.  A more sophisticated analysis incorporating these factors is necessary for a true assessment of each company's chances.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_match, 'answer': response_match.text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T21:56:01.188791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T21:56:01.189180Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T21:56:01.194340Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T21:56:01.189147Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T21:56:01.193289Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generate the clause-by-clause","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"user_prompt = \"\"\"\n\nConsider the company with the highest affinity score \nand return the clause by clause analysis considering technical and commercial compliant and not-compliant requirements\nof the tender with respect to the selected company.

This will require thorough cost estimation, including materials, labor, transport, and profit margins.\n\n* **Payment Terms:**  Clear and favorable payment terms will be necessary for a competitive bid.\n\n* **Contractual Clauses:**  The tender will likely contain various contractual clauses related to liability, insurance, dispute resolution, and project completion deadlines.  Siemens Energy must ensure full compliance.\n\n\n**Non-Compliance & Partial Compliance:**\n\nThe main area requiring further attention is item 22 (Solar Home Systems).  The provided Siemens text doesn't include SHS as a standard product offering. A specific proposal and sourcing strategy would need to be developed for this item.  Similarly, items 7 (Powerhouse buildings) and 13-21 need more detail to assess full compliance.\n\n\nThis clause-by-clause analysis provides a preliminary assessment.  A complete tender response requires significantly more detailed information and a thorough review of the full tender documents.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_clause_by_clause, 'answer': response_clause_by_clause.text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.438617Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.439096Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.444665Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.439009Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.443622Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Count the overall tokens","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The total number of token can be computed by counting the tokens of history_chat, since the new responses have been appended to it for each call of Gemini.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"{model.count_tokens(history_chat)=}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.445937Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.446279Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T21:57:49.959957Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T21:57:41.446247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T21:57:49.958903Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"model.count_tokens(history_chat)=total_tokens: 666325\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25}]}
