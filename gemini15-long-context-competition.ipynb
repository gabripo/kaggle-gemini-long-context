For example:\n\n- **Technical and Commercial Tender Agents**: Separate prompts (tender_prompt_template_technical and tender_prompt_template_commercial) guide the roles of the technical tender engineer and commercial tender manager. Each user has distinct objectives: identifying and summarizing technical or commercial requirements within tenders. \n\n- A distinct prompt (**Sales Manager\"\") is also prepared for analyzing companies (e.g., SIEMENS and HITACHI) to match tender requirements with their products and solutions (get_response_companies_info). This allows tailored reasoning for comparing affinities between tenders and company offerings.\n\n## Chain of Thoughts 🧩\n\nIn both technical and commercial prompts, we used phrases like \"Think step by step\" to guide the agent toward incremental reasoning. This ensures that requirements are dissected and analyzed in detail.\nThe user prompt specifies a structured approach to calculating an affinity score, prompting the agent to explicitly explain the calculation process. Finally, in the Clause-by-Clause Analysis, the final prompt directs the agent to meticulously compare tender requirements with company specifications, maintaining a clear progression in thought. \n\n## In-chat Memory and caching 🗃️\n\nIn-chat memory stores all the interactions from the technical and commercial tender analysis, and from the companies website. It keeps track of the responses from the different roles (e.g., technical engineer, commercial manager, sales manager). This memory allows to build upon the context of earlier prompts without having to constantly reprocess the same information. \nAn alternative method with context caching is also tested.\nWith context caching the system stores intermediate results from prior tender evaluations or company analyses, so if a similar query arises, the system can quickly retrieve relevant data and produce faster, more accurate responses.\nStay tuned for the interesting comparison between the two methods.\n\n## Conclusion for the Use Case \n\nUsing a long context window instead of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for this use case was particularly beneficial due to the task's nature, which involves reasoning across interdependent documents. The unified context allows the model to cross-reference tender requirements and company offerings directly, ensuring cohesive and accurate analysis. This is particularly advantageous for tasks like affinity scoring, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple data points.\nThe notebook's approach scales better for handling multiple queries simultaneously, as it avoids the bottleneck of sequential agent calls. For new tender projects, it's only necessary to update the in-chat memory.\n\n*In summary, why did we decide to build this notebook?*\n\n1. **Holistic Context Retention**: By storing the entire history of tender analyses (both technical and commercial) and company solution evaluations, the model retains a comprehensive understanding of all previously provided information. This holistic context allows the model to reason about how specific requirements and offerings interrelate across multiple prompts. In RAG, the system retrieves only the most relevant chunks of information for each query; this efficient approach can lead to fragmented analyses, potentially overlooking interconnections.\n\n2. **Dynamic Role-based Collaboration**: By maintaining a long context, the system allows outputs from technical engineers, commercial managers, and sales managers to flow into a unified reasoning framework. A long context window naturally informs each role, creating a seamless chain of thought.\n\n3. **Reduced Query Overhead**: Long context windows reduce the need for multiple retrieval calls, making the process more efficient in scenarios where information is revisited or refined iteratively. RAG introduces latency and computational costs because each query requires searching and ranking document chunks. \n\n4. **Affinity Score Calculation**: Computing an affinity score across companies for tenders requires integrating technical and commercial analysis alongside company data. This step benefits significantly from the model's ability to access all previous responses simultaneously.\n\n5. **Clause-by-Clause Compliance Analysis**: Clause-by-clause analysis relies on cross-referencing previously extracted requirements with company offerings. The long context window with conteoxt caching allows the model to directly reference earlier inputs and outputs without reloading or retrieving.\n\n\n## Conclusion \n\n#### The long context window acts as a shared workspace, recording and making all roles outputs accessible for seamless and holistic reasoning. In today's interconnected world, where partnerships and synergies are essential to addressing complex challenges, we envision a tool that enables continuous reasoning, uncovers new patterns and solutions, and minimizes the fragmentation of insights.\n\n\n\n\n### Related Projects and Future steps 🔍💡\n\n- The data generation and cleaning is performed with another repo stored in github:  https://github.com/gabripo/kaggle-gemini-long-context.\n\n- In the past few months, we also implemented a multi-agent framework (LumadaAI) using LangChain and OpenAI, where each company was represented by a dedicated agent.\n  **LumadaAI** is publicly available at https://github.com/SecchiAlessandro/LumadaAI.\n  This framework featured a supervisor agent that dynamically routed user queries to the most relevant company-specific agent based on the query context. While innovative, this approach faced challenges in stability, accuracy, and efficiency, making the current solution more effective. As agents operated independently, generating combined solutions from different companies was difficult. Additionally, for each query, the supervisor needed to perform additional reasoning before invoking an agent. If a query was relevant to multiple agents, the framework had to perform sequential calls, compounding latency. The current solution with centralized reasoning ensures consistent application of logic and context.\n\n- **EasyRAG** (https://github.com/gabripo/easyrag) is another RAG tool that performs RAG over locally stored documents. We are benchmarking this tool with Gemini's long context window: adding one or more PDFs to Gemini's context window could provide more precise insights than the RAG approach.\n\n- In the next weeks we are curious to exploit the multimodal potential of Gemini. With a similar concept presented in this notebook, we want to use an input video of a job candidate's attitude and skills to identify the best matches or highlight differences compared to a video from the company's professional and behavioral requirements.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import Python libraries\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.777322Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.777689Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.790277Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.777646Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.788961Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary function to read JSON files\ndef read_json_info(jsonFilePath: str) -> dict:\n    if os.path.exists(jsonFilePath):\n        with open(jsonFilePath, \"r\") as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n        return data\n    else:\n        return {}","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.792057Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.792512Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.804001Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.792466Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:27:59.803001Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary Python decorator to execute a function again, if its execution fails\n# this is helpful when calling the Gemini's API since Gemini has a rate limiter and, if an execution fails for that, there will be some waiting time before retrying\nimport time\n\ndef retry_on_failure(wait_time_seconds=60, max_retries=5):\n    def decorator_retry(func):\n        \n        def wrapper_retry(*args, **kwargs):\n            retries = 0\n            while retries < max_retries:\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    retries += 1\n                    if retries < max_retries:\n                        print(\n                            f\"Function failed with error: {e}.

Since the prompt doesn't directly provide the specific requirements, I'll assume a generalized set of needs common to both types of renewable energy projects based on the previous responses.  This includes items like power generation, energy storage, grid connection, automation/control, and digital services for monitoring and maintenance.\n\n**I.  Relevant Products and Solutions:**\n\n**A. Siemens:**\n\n* **Wind Energy:**\n    * **Gas Turbines:**  The SGT-50 (up to 2 MW), SGT-400 (10-15 MW), SGT5-8000H (up to 450 MW), SGT5-9000HL (up to 593 MW), and SGT6-5000F (up to 260 MW) are relevant depending on project scale.  These offer fuel flexibility (including hydrogen), fast start-up, and low emissions. (URLs for each model were provided in the original prompt).\n    * **Generators:**  SGen series generators, adaptable to different turbine types and power ratings.\n    * **High-Voltage Substations:** For grid connection, including AIS and GIS options and prefabricated solutions. (URL provided).\n    * **Digital Solutions (Omnivise Portfolio):** Omnivise Asset Management, Omnivise Performance Solutions, Omnivise Hybrid Control, and Omnivise Electrical Solutions, and the GT Auto Tuner for optimization and remote monitoring. (URLs provided).\n    * **Lifecycle Services:**  For long-term support and maintenance of turbines, generators, and substations. (URL provided).\n* **Solar Energy:**\n    *  Siemens' offerings in solar energy are less directly apparent in the provided text.\n\n**B. Hitachi Energy:**\n\n* **Wind Energy:**\n    * **High-Voltage Switchgear:**  Includes AIS and GIS options, potentially including SF6-free \"Blue\" technology. (URLs provided).\n    * **Transformers:**  For step-up and grid connection. (URL provided).\n    * **Reactors:** Shunt reactors for reactive power compensation, potentially including variable shunt reactors. (URL provided).\n    * **Surge Arresters:** For overvoltage protection. (URL provided).\n    * **Digital Substation Solutions:** Increasing controllability, renewable integration, and safety.  (URL provided).\n    * **Grid-eXpand™:** Modular grid connection solutions for faster deployment and cost savings. (URL provided).\n* **Solar Energy:**\n    * **High-Voltage Switchgear:**  Similar to wind energy applications,  AIS, GIS, and “Blue” solutions are potentially relevant.  (URLs provided).\n    * **Transformers:**  For step-up and grid connection. (URL provided).\n    * **Digital Substation Solutions:**  Also relevant for solar energy grid integration. (URL provided).\n    * **Grid-eXpand™:** Again, a relevant solution for efficient grid connections. (URL provided)\n\n\n**II. Affinity Score Calculation:**\n\nTo calculate the affinity score, we'll assign points to each company based on the number of relevant product categories mentioned.  I'll use a simplified system for demonstration; a more robust scoring system would involve weighting different product categories based on their importance in each tender.  Let's assume the following weights for categories:\n\n* **Power Generation (Wind/Solar):** 3 points (essential)\n* **Energy Storage:** 2 points (highly important)\n* **Grid Connection:** 2 points (highly important)\n* **Automation/Control:** 2 points (highly important)\n* **Digital Services:** 2 points (highly important)\n\n\n**A. Siemens Scoring:**\n\n* **Power Generation (Wind):** 3 points (Gas Turbines)\n* **Grid Connection:** 2 points (High-Voltage Substations)\n* **Automation/Control:** 2 points (Omnivise Portfolio)\n* **Digital Services:** 2 points (Omnivise Portfolio, Lifecycle Services)\n* **Power Generation (Solar):** 0 points (not explicitly mentioned)\n* **Energy Storage:** 0 points (not explicitly mentioned)\n\n**Total Siemens Score:** 9 points\n\n\n**B. Hitachi Energy Scoring:**\n\n* **Power Generation (Wind):** 0 points (Not explicitly mentioned)\n* **Energy Storage:** 0 points (Not explicitly mentioned)\n* **Grid Connection:** 2 points (Grid-eXpand™)\n* **Automation/Control:** 2 points (Substation Automation, protection and control solutions)\n* **Digital Services:** 2 points (Various digital monitoring and management solutions within the text)\n* **Power Generation (Solar):** 0 points (Not explicitly mentioned)\n\n**Total Hitachi Energy Score:** 6 points\n\n**Affinity Score Calculation:**\n\nTo convert the scores to percentages, we'll assume a maximum possible score for a complete match of all categories is 11 points (5 categories * maximum 2 points + 1 category with 3 points). Therefore:\n\n* **Siemens Affinity Score:** (9/11) * 100% ≈ 82%\n* **Hitachi Energy Affinity Score:** (6/11) * 100% ≈ 55%\n\n**III. Explanation:**\n\nThe affinity score represents the percentage match between the company's product portfolio and the generalized needs of the tenders.  Siemens scores higher because its portfolio more directly addresses the assumed requirements, particularly in the wind energy sector through offering of turbines, generators, substations and digital solutions.   Hitachi Energy's score is lower, primarily due to its solutions being less directly related to the power generation aspect (though they have strong offerings in grid connection and automation).  This calculation is a simplification; a more sophisticated analysis would require a detailed breakdown of the tender requirements and weighting of different criteria based on their relative importance.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_match, 'answer': responses['prompt_match'].text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:40:54.075958Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:40:54.076971Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:40:54.08279Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:40:54.076918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:40:54.081725Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Generate the clause-by-clause","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"user_prompt = \"\"\"\n\nConsider the company with the highest affinity score and return the clause by clause analysis considering technical and commercial compliant and not-compliant requirements of the tender with respect to the selected company.

Conclusion:**\n\nSiemens demonstrates significant capability to meet many of the assumed technical requirements of the tender, particularly concerning power generation (wind) and digital solutions.  However, gaps exist in energy storage and some aspects of environmental compliance, which would necessitate further clarification and detailed specification in a complete bid.  Commercial requirements are addressed separately.  A more thorough analysis would require precise tender specifications to determine full compliance and the relative importance of each clause.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":33},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# add the last response to the chat history\nadd_history_to_chat_single({'prompt': prompt_clause_by_clause, 'answer': responses['prompt_clause_by_close'].text}, \"technical engineer\", history_chat)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:50:07.127312Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:50:07.127714Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:50:07.132928Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:50:07.127681Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:50:07.131952Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Count the overall tokens","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The total number of token can be computed by counting the tokens of history_chat, since the new responses have been appended to it for each call of Gemini.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"{model.count_tokens(history_chat)=}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:50:09.58507Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:50:09.585627Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:50:17.135102Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:50:09.585587Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:50:17.13412Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"model.count_tokens(history_chat)=total_tokens: 694248\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Alternative usage of Gemini: Context caching","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As the entire dataset consists in JSON files, it could be cached using the Context caching functionality of Gemini:\n\nhttps://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching?lang=python\n\nWith context caching the system stores intermediate results from prior tender evaluations or company analyses, so if a similar query arises, the system can quickly retrieve relevant data and produce faster, more accurate responses.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# to ensure that no caching limit is exceeded, flush all the already available caches\nfrom google.generativeai import caching\n\ndef delete_caches() -> None:\n    for c in caching.CachedContent.list():\n        print(f\"Deleting cache named \\\"{c.display_name}\\\" ...\")\n        c.delete()\n    print(\"All the caches have been deleted!\")\n\ndelete_caches()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T21:57:03.39738Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T21:57:03.398121Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T21:57:04.280169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T21:57:03.39808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T21:57:04.279143Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"All the caches have been deleted!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":53},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import google.generativeai as genai\nimport time\n\n@retry_on_failure(wait_time_seconds=10, max_retries=2)\ndef process_file_for_caching(file_path: str) -> genai.types.file_types.File | None:\n    if os.path.exists(file_path):\n        loaded_file = genai.upload_file(file_path)\n        \n        while loaded_file.state.name == \"PROCESSING\":\n            print(f\"Processing file {file_path} ...\")\n            time.sleep(2)\n            loaded_file = genai.get_file(loaded_file.name)\n        print(f\"Processing file {file_path} completed.
