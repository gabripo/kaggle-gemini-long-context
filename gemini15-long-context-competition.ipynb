For example:\n\n- **Technical and Commercial Tender Agents**: Separate prompts (tender_prompt_template_technical and tender_prompt_template_commercial) guide the roles of the technical tender engineer and commercial tender manager. Each agent has distinct objectives: identifying and summarizing technical or commercial requirements within tenders. This multi-agent structure ensures detailed and domain-specific analyses. 👷‍♂️💼\n\n- A distinct prompt is also prepared for analyzing companies (e.g., SIEMENS and HITACHI) to match tender requirements with their products and solutions (get_response_companies_info). This allows tailored reasoning for comparing affinities between tenders and company offerings. 🏢🔄\n\n## Chain of Thoughts 🧩\n\nThe chain of thoughts approach decomposes complex tasks into sequential, step-by-step actions, ensuring methodical problem-solving. In both technical and commercial prompts, we used phrases like \"Think step by step\" to guide the agent toward incremental reasoning. This ensures that requirements are dissected and analyzed in detail. 🔍🧠\n\nThe user prompt specifies a structured approach to calculating an affinity score, prompting the agent to explicitly explain the calculation process. Finally, in the Clause-by-Clause Analysis, the final prompt directs the agent to meticulously compare tender requirements with company specifications, maintaining a clear progression in thought. This approach is embedded in the tender query processing and the affinity scoring logic in user_prompt_match and final_prompt, encouraging logical progression in the analysis. 📈🔗\n\n## In-chat Memory 🗃️\n\nThe code uses in-chat memory to maintain conversational context across multiple interactions. This functionality is facilitated by:\n\n- **Chat History Preservation**: The function add_history_to_chat appends user queries and model responses (e.g., for tenders or company analyses) to history_chat. This ensures continuity, enabling the model to refer back to previous inputs and outputs during subsequent exchanges. 📝🔄\n\n- Prompts such as system_prompt and user_prompt leverage the accumulated chat history to enhance the depth and relevance of responses. For example, when computing affinity scores or performing a clause-by-clause analysis, the model can reference earlier content in the chat_with_memory object. This allows continuous improvement of the prompt and on the information stored in the chat. 🗣️🔍\n\n## Conclusion for the Use Case 🤔\n\nUsing a long context window instead of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for this use case was particularly beneficial due to the task's nature, which involves reasoning across interdependent documents while maintaining conversational continuity and ensuring consistent context for decision-making. The unified context allows the model to cross-reference tender requirements and company offerings directly, ensuring cohesive and accurate analysis. This is particularly advantageous for tasks like affinity scoring, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple data points. 📊🔗\n\nThe notebook's approach scales better for handling multiple queries simultaneously, as it avoids the bottleneck of sequential agent calls. For new tender projects, it's only necessary to update the in-chat memory and add new prompts for adding new in-chat agents. 🔄🔄\n\nIn summary, why did we decide to build this notebook?\n\n1. **Holistic Context Retention** 📚: By storing the entire history of tender analyses (both technical and commercial) and company product evaluations, the model retains a comprehensive understanding of all previously provided information. This holistic context allows the model to reason about how specific requirements and offerings interrelate across multiple prompts. In RAG, the system retrieves only the most relevant chunks of information for each query; this efficient approach can lead to fragmented analyses, potentially overlooking interconnections.\n\n2. **Interdependent Analysis** 🔄: This task involves comparing multiple tenders against products and solutions offered by different companies, followed by calculating an affinity score and conducting a clause-by-clause compliance analysis. These steps require accessible and integrated information from previous steps. RAG typically retrieves context independently for each query, which might result in a loss of nuance or context-dependent reasoning, especially when relationships between multiple documents must be preserved. A long context window ensures the model has immediate access to the entire conversational flow and insights developed so far.\n\n3. **Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration** 🤝: By maintaining a long context, the system can simulate multi-agent collaboration, allowing outputs from technical engineers, commercial managers, and sales managers to flow into a unified reasoning framework. In RAG, each role’s analysis would require re-retrieving relevant information, possibly leading to inconsistencies or duplications. A long context window naturally informs each role, creating a seamless chain of thought.\n\n4. **Reduced Query Overhead** 🔄: Long context windows reduce the need for multiple retrieval calls, making the process more efficient in scenarios where information is revisited or refined iteratively. RAG introduces latency and computational costs because each query requires searching and ranking document chunks. A long context window allows for continuous focus on the task, with all prior exchanges readily available.\n\n5. **Affinity Score Calculation** 📈: Computing an affinity score across companies for tenders requires integrating technical and commercial analysis alongside company data. This step benefits significantly from the model's ability to access all previous responses simultaneously. In RAG, affinity scoring would require separate retrievals of technical requirements, commercial requirements, and company data for each tender. This could introduce discrepancies if context for one query is inadvertently excluded during retrieval.\n\n6. **Clause-by-Clause Compliance Analysis** 🔄: Clause-by-clause analysis relies on cross-referencing previously extracted requirements with company offerings. The long context window allows the model to directly reference earlier inputs and outputs without reloading or retrieving. RAG retrievals for clause-by-clause analysis might lead to inconsistencies if prior reasoning is split across multiple retrievals. A long context window ensures the model \"remembers\" and applies earlier analyses cohesively.\n\n### Related Projects and Open Points 📁\n\nThe data generation and cleaning is performed with another repo stored in github:  https://github.com/gabripo/kaggle-gemini-long-context.\n\nIn the past few months, we also implemented a multi-agent framework (LumadaAI) using LangChain and OpenAI, where each company was represented by a dedicated agent. **LumadaAI** is publicly available at https://github.com/SecchiAlessandro/LumadaAI. This framework featured a supervisor agent that dynamically routed user queries to the most relevant company-specific agent based on the query context. While innovative, this approach faced challenges in stability, accuracy, and efficiency, making the current solution more effective. As agents operated independently, generating combined solutions from different companies was difficult. Additionally, for each query, the supervisor needed to perform additional reasoning before invoking an agent. If a query was relevant to multiple agents, the framework had to perform sequential calls, compounding latency. The current solution with centralized reasoning ensures consistent application of logic and context. By avoiding the intermediate step of agent selection, it directly processes queries with unified context, reducing latency significantly. \n\n**EasyRAG** (https://github.com/gabripo/easyrag) is another RAG tool that performs RAG over locally stored documents. We are benchmarking this tool with Gemini's long context window: adding one or more PDFs to Gemini's context window could provide more precise insights than the RAG approach. 📈\n\n## Conclusion 🔽\n\nThe centralized, long context window approach provides clear advantages in stability, response time, and accuracy over the earlier multi-agent framework. It highlights the importance of selecting a system architecture that aligns with the specific demands of the use case, particularly for complex, multi-faceted analyses like those in tender evaluations, clause-by-clause generation, and company affinity scoring. 📊🔗\n\n#### The long context window acts as a shared workspace, recording and making all agent outputs accessible for seamless and holistic reasoning. In today's interconnected world, where partnerships and synergies are essential to addressing complex challenges, we envision a tool that enables continuous reasoning, uncovers new patterns and solutions, and minimizes the fragmentation of insights. 🌐🔍💡\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import Python libraries\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.852018Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.852328Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.876257Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.852297Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.875331Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary function to read JSON files\ndef read_json_info(jsonFilePath: str) -> dict:\n    if os.path.exists(jsonFilePath):\n        with open(jsonFilePath, \"r\") as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n        return data\n    else:\n        return {}","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.878444Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.878750Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.884030Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.878721Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-25T21:36:09.882976Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# auxiliary Python decorator to execute a function again, if its execution fails\n# this is helpful when calling the Gemini's API since Gemini has a rate limiter and, if an execution fails for that, there will be some waiting time before retrying\nimport time\n\ndef retry_on_failure(wait_time_seconds=60, max_retries=5):\n    def decorator_retry(func):\n        \n        def wrapper_retry(*args, **kwargs):\n            retries = 0\n            while retries < max_retries:\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    retries += 1\n                    if retries < max_retries:\n                        print(\n                            f\"Function failed with error: {e}.
