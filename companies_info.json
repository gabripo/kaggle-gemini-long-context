    "SIEMENS": "The page with name \"Power generation and distribution\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/power-generation-and-distribution.html\" has the following content:\nNearly all onboard processes require electrical power and a reliable power distribution system. With electrical power generation and distribution solutions for vessels, Siemens Energy ensures that power can be generated, distributed, and used exactly where it is needed. This guarantees the functionality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of vessels of all sizes and types. \nOur customized, intelligent electrical power distribution solutions for vessels of all kinds are designed for maximum performance, reliability, and scalability – in conjunction with the vessel’s automation and propulsion system, if desired. We supply you with leading technological concepts, technical components, and services, from the power plant through power distribution to all consumer devices to the energy management system. All this comes from a single source, based on standardized components that are used in marine electrical systems on commercial ships worldwide and are quickly available anywhere. \nPower LV is an integrated, modular, and scalable system for providing a reliable and economical onboard power supply in low-voltage technology. \nPower MV is our solution for the onboard medium-voltage supply. It comprises all central components in medium-voltage technology.  \nSISHIP Boost with WHRS is a waste-heat recovery system for vessels that helps reduce your energy costs by up to 12 percent. \nWith SISHIP BlueDrive Eco, the SISHIP BlueDrive family is now offering scalable solutions for all drive requirements, covering diverse performance graduations for small to medium-sized drives, from 5 KW in auxiliary mode up to 5.5 MW in main drives. \nThe PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be significantly extended, which minimizes the risk of detection. \nThe operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system.  \nThere is hardly a process on board that will function without electrical power. Power LV ensures the efficient generation, distribution, and management of this power. With its integral protective mechanisms, the system achieves the highest level of supply security and functionality. \nPower LV is an integrated, modular, and scalable system for providing a reliable and economical onboard power supply in low-voltage technology. It comprises brushless synchronous generators to support all extremes of power demand, switchgear specially developed for marine use, and a power management system. In addition, various transformers and frequency converters come online to support system demands. The vessel’s generator, switchgear, transformers, and converters for the low-voltage supply can be freely combined as required, with the energy management system ensuring optimized interactions. \nThanks to integrated protection mechanisms (for example, short-circuit protection, electromagnetic compatibility, shock resistance, and automatic blackout start-up function), the low-voltage system achieves outstanding reliability with optimal efficiency, while minimizing fuel consumption by the vessel’s generator. \nYour advantages with Power LV \nVessels such as frigates or cruise ships not only have extremely high energy requirements but also place heavy demands on the operating security and fail-safe performance of the onboard electricity supply. Our Power MV system fulfills these requirements with low capital costs. \nPower MV is our solution for the onboard medium-voltage supply. Power MV comprises all central components in medium-voltage technology, including the vessel’s generator, transformers, and switchgear, and is based on reliable, standardized components. \nTo ensure the maximum availability and safety of the power supply from the vessel’s generator at all times, Power MV is equipped with mechanical protection devices for every required safety level. The medium-voltage system – consisting of the vessel’s generator, switchgear, and energy management system – is designed redundantly to guarantee the reliable, optimized generation and distribution of medium-voltage power on board. The onboard low-voltage system is supplied via transformers. \nYour advantages with Power MV \nFuel consumption is one of the largest cost items in ship operation. Remaining competitive over the long term will require highly efficient drive solutions and intelligent energy management. At the same time, environmentally friendly technologies are called for to comply with ever-stricter environmental protection regulations. The waste-heat recovery system WHRS is the best way to meet both requirements. \nSISHIP Boost with WHRS is a waste-heat recovery system for vessels that helps reduce your energy costs by up to 12 percent. The waste-heat recovery system utilizes the heat from exhaust gases to generate steam and produce additional electrical power. It not only cuts your energy costs, but also reduces the CO2 and NOx emissions of your vessel. Additionally, you gain more flexibility in vessel design. Smaller fuel tanks permit a more creative use of space and line, and the ship’s main drive can get by with a lower-rated output. Dependable, internationally available, standard components and our well-established spare parts logistics facilitate maintenance and provide you with maximum reliability. \nAll the functionalities of the WHRS are controlled using an energy management system that ensures optimal use of the available energy and automatically adapts shaft generator operation to current requirements. That means you are able to access additional power reserves, reduce wear and tear on the main engine, and increase the reliability of the onboard power supply. \nYour advantages with WHRS \nSiemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens. \nWith the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system. \nYour advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC \nThe synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent. \nThe SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control, and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC. \nSISHIP BlueDrive Eco combines the experience from both systems SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC and SISHIP EcoProp. SISHIP EcoProp is well known as a flexible, compact, high-power diesel-electric propulsion system for smaller vessels such as yachts, ferries, and public authority vessels. Like the complete SISHIP BlueDrive Family, SISHIP BlueDrive Eco uses the Siemens Energy industrial converter platform components, providing very high reliability and availability. It enables scalable systems from 5 kW inverter power use and closes the power range (to BlueDrive PlusC up to 5.5 MW inverter power), all in the same topology. \nThe advanced lithium-ion battery-based solution BlueVault for offshore installations and marine vessels is suited for both all-electric and hybrid energy-storage applications. BlueVault energy storage solutions are designed to help ensure continuity of power and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions. \nThe battery is designed to maximize life, performance, and safety. It is equipped with an integrated battery management system and overload/short circuit protection. The storage modules with 6.6 kWh Li-Ion batteries can be slid into a rack. The battery storage cubicle consists of 9 modules and 60 kWh. The cubicles can be easily lined up to the total required battery capacity. \nA fundamental requirement of submarines is to run silently and remain submerged in certain situations. Conventional diesel-electric drive models need to periodically surface to recharge their batteries, making the boat vulnerable. Our PEM fuel cells deliver an atmospheric air-independent, noiseless propulsion solution for power generation on board that can extend the dive time by several weeks. \nThe PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be extended to weeks, if required, which significantly minimizes the risk of being detected. That’s because the PEM fuel cell modules use oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity, so the potential dive time is restricted only by the supply of stored media and the boat’s energy demand. The system works without atmospheric air and is completely exhaust-free. \nAnother important advantage is that the PEM fuel cell has an ultimately low signature in operation: This helps reducing the aggregate acoustic signature of the submarine. The system’s noise signature lies well under all threshold values. With their electrochemical properties, the fuel cells themselves operate noiselessly. Even the ancillary units are optimized for low noise or can be easily incorporated into noise encapsulation thanks to their compact design. \nYour advantages with PEM fuel cells \nThe operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system. Our SG-DC supply and switching system delivers a reliable power supply to the propulsion system and the various onboard networks. \nTo secure the optimum power supply for your boat in any situation, SG-DC ensures the supply, distribution, and monitoring of electrical energy for the propulsion system and all onboard networks. It is the ideal equipment for meeting the specific requirements of submarines with respect to shock and vibration resistance, electromagnetic shielding and acoustics, and external influences such as temperature, air humidity, and air pressure. \nSG-DC incorporates the main control panel for connecting the energy producers to the propulsion system, and also the auxiliary power distribution for the individual consumers and all onboard networks. The system is tailored to the individual requirements of every boat and its key characteristics are superb reliability, compact build, and low maintenance. \nYour advantages with DC switchgear \nIf you want to learn more about our offering for the marine sectors, don’t hesitate to contact us.

The three inspection scopes offered are Visual, Siemens Multifrequency Core Assessment System (SMCAS™️) and Wedge Tightness. The visual inspection utilizes on board camera(s) that are capable of digitally recording video and still images used to look for visual signs of overheating, excessive relative motion, ventilation blockages in stator or rotor vent paths and possible foreign objects. SMCAS™️ is a test that evaluates core laminations for circulating currents the same as EL CID. A feature that SMCAS™️ offers is the ability to digitally overlay previously recorded SMCAS™️results to compare for trending over the life cycle of the stator core. Wedge Tightness testing is used to assess the loading force of generator stator wedges and is a helpful tool to predict a possible outage of sufficient length when loose or loosening stator wedges need to be replaced. \nWith 3 decades of field use comes significant innovation. Siemens Energy at the Pittsburgh Service Center has begun to incorporate additive manufacturing to the latest design updates that allow for more rapid customization of inspection components that can be attached to the modular base of the FAST Gen tooling or even complete standalone solutions. This enables the Pittsburgh Service Center to help meet an ever-increasing demand of non-OEM inspection requests where generator access may offer unique obstacles. \nLoop Testing is performed to identify and restore insulation between core laminations, (if interlaminar insulation has broken down). \nHigh Frequency Flux Test \nModal analysis determines the natural frequencies and mode shapes of turbine-generator static structures across the relevant frequency ranges of operation. Testing ensures that during operation the structure is tuned away from resonant conditions that increases structure fatigue and chance of failure. Modal analysis can be performed in the field or the factory. \nModal analysis applications include: \nFurther comprehensive Siemens Generator Service Capabilities can be offered upon request. \nIf you have any questions or would like to find out how we can help you to modernize your generator equipment, please let us know. \nThe page with name \"Generator Service Capabilities\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/generator-service-capabilities.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SIPAPER Drive Systems\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/drive-systems.html\" has the following content:\nDriving the performance and efficiency of paper productions to the max \nThe paper industry is facing challenges that could not be more contradictory.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid. \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues. \nBy Frank Jossi \nIn line with shared commitments to decarbonize, National Grid and Siemens Energy are teaming up to undertake a cutting-edge upgrade of a National Grid substation using Siemens Energy designed fluorinated gas free “Blue circuit breakers” with clean air insulation and vacuum switching technology. \nWhile we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nOur dead tank breaker family is available for applications from 72.5 kV up to 550 kV and for short-circuit interruption up to 90 kA. DT breakers up to 362 kV are equipped with one interrupter unit per pole, up to 550 kV with two interrupter units.  \nWe provide dead tank circuit breakers with 2-cycle operation for applications up to 362 kV. The circuit breakers can be equipped with optional closing resistors or applications from 362 kV to 550 kV. Several current transformer solutions are at your disposal which can be realized according to your specific project requirements. \nOur high-voltage dead tank circuit breakers are available for three-pole operation with a common base, for single-pole operation also with a common base or for single-pole operation with separate bases. \nYou can find details on our dead tank circuit breakers and information about our services here. \nSiemens Energy fairs, events & webinars \nWhitepapers & Recordings  \nThe page with name \"Dead tank circuit breakers\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/dead-tank.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT5-4000F Heavy-duty gas turbine (50 Hz)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgt5-4000f.html\" has the following content:\nThe robust SGT5-4000F gas turbine has been optimized for outstanding performance and excellent efficiency. Easy maintenance results in short outages, making sure your gas turbine achieves highest availability. \nIts internal cooling air passages support reliable long-term operation and a fast start-up capability. Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO) reduces clearance losses to increase  gas turbine efficiency and minimize degradation at start-up and shutdown.  \nThe proven SGT5-4000F gas turbine is characterized by high performance, low power generation costs, long intervals between inspections, and a service-friendly design. Optimized flow and cooling add up to high gas turbine efficiency and very economical power generation in combined cycle applications.  \nThe gas turbine boasts excellent fast cold start and hot restart capabilities thanks to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages, the advanced annular combustion system and the Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO) active clearance control.  The SGT5-4000F achieves combined cycle base load within 30 min for hot start. \nExtensive experience in commercial operation means that you can rely on proven and validated package and plant concepts that enable early power generation in simple cycle. Projects are implemented quickly. Since no external rotor air cooler is required, this simplifies the plant integration even further. \nThe engine's blade design is based on proven materials and tried and tested know-how, while incorporating the latest aerodynamic technologies. The first three turbine stages are thermal barrier-coated. Your benefit: long service life and low maintenance.  \nThe SGT5-4000F offers dual fuel capability and tolerates fuels within a wide Wobbe range. You might need to adjust the burner configuration when the Wobbe index of the fuel gas varies by more than ±15%.   The SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to handle different fuel compositions, e.g. natural gas with high contents on hydrogen (up to 30 vol%), propane, ethylene and butane, as well as inert gases (N2, CO2, He, Ar, etc.). Furthermore, the SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to run on fuels with higher amounts of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) of up to 4000 ppm. The fuel system can switch over quickly between fuel gas and fuel oil and vice versa.  \nWet Compression option Wet Compression (WetC) increases the power output by injecting water into the gas turbine inlet. This optional SGT5-4000F feature can be used for peak-load machines to benefit from high electricity prices WetC enhances the turbine performance by reducing compressor inlet temperatures and increasing the mass flow throughout the turbine. Excess fog droplets evaporate in the compressor and produce an additional intercooling effect. \nChiller System option The chiller is a heat exchanger, which cools down the compressor intake air in order to increase the gas turbine base load performance. The system can decrease the compressor inlet temperature far below the dew point of the ambience. A chiller system can generate benefits in dry regions, where the high water consumption of other inlet air cooling options is undesirable. \nEvaporative Cooling option The system decreases compressor inlet temperature through humidification, raises relative humidity and increases the air mass flow, resulting in higher turbine output power and efficiency. Evaporative cooling is the favorable system in dry and hot ambient. \nWith its high steam raising capability, the SGT5-4000F is excellently suited for cogeneration or combined heat an power (CHP) applications, e.g, for \nFor combined cycle applications with CHP, you can use a condensing or backpressure steam turbine, with or without steam extraction. \nThe SGT5-4000F entered the market in 1996. Today, more than 360 turbines are sold worldwide, and the installed fleet has an accumulated fleet experience of more than 23 million equivalent operating hours (EOHs). The fleet reliability exceeds 99%. \nCharacterized by its robust design, the SGT5-4000F boasts a proven 15-stage axial flow compressor, a durable annular combustion system, and a fully air-cooled 4-stage turbine. The moderate compressor pressure ratio provides a low impact on critical components. The rotor is based on self-centering and -aligning discs with Hirth serration and central tie rod, providing you with the advantage of fast and easy on-site rotor destacking and balancing. Internal cooling air passages reduce the stress on critical components and ensure a long service life. \nVariable inlet guide vanes plus two stages of fast-acting variable-pitch guide vanes (VGV) improve the part load efficiency and optimize the performance over a wide range of operating conditions. \nOn-board valves provide controlled cooling air supply with low cooling air consumption, leading to high efficiency. \nThe gas turbine package for the SGT5-4000F consists of the core turbine, the generator (SGen5-2000P or SGen5-2000H) and auxiliary systems. We offer you a standardized basic design with options geared to your specific requirements. By using standard components and preassembly or prepackaging we achieve short installation times, with staggered delivery and early shipment of main components. We group subsystems and install them in separate auxiliary packages to minimize field assembly. \nDesigned for short installation times, all package piping is prefabricated to minimize pipe cleaning and welding on site. \nPackage footprint: \nThe air intake is suitable for different multistage filters, e.g., pre-filter, fine- and/or HEPA filter or self-cleaning pulse filter systems, which secure operation even at harsh ambient conditions (e.g., sandy, dusty or polluted). The use of an air intake silencer significantly reduces the pressure drop with improved noise reduction, thus ensuring compliance with noise protection regulations. Anti-icing systems and inlet air cooling with evaporative cooler are available as an option. \nSGT5-4000F-based combined cycle plants have the capability for fast start-up. With these plants, you can achieve combined cycle base load in less than 30 min for hot start. High load gradients allow for fast load changes. With excellent peaking capability, and high part load efficiency complying with emission regulations down to lower part load, this is your profitable solution for competitive energy markets with fluctuating power demand. \nThe main components of this power plant are arranged on a single shaft, with a synchronous self-shifting (SSS) clutch installed between the generator and the SST5-3000 steam turbine. The result: a small footprint, and high operational flexibility and reliability. For combined heat and power (CHP) applications, up to a 3-stage extraction for district heating or process steam is available. \nThe multi-shaft plants are based on two or more SGT5-4000F gas turbine packages and a steam turbine, e.g., the SST5-5000 steam turbine. The plants use heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) with Benson high-pressure (HP) evaporators and integrated fast-start technology. Providing you with high operational flexibility, they can operate from part load simple cycle up to full load combined cycle.  \nWe offer Long Term Programs (LTP), overhaul services, field service, spare parts, reconditioning of components and modernization upgrades.

Our surge arresters protect devices in equipment for applications up to 1,200 kV. \nMain features: \nSiemens Energy 3EL silicone rubber surge arresters with cage design provide outstanding protection against overvoltages in networks up to 800 kV. \nSiemens Energy 3 EL cage design surge arresters are ideally suited for the reliable protection of: \nThe cage, made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) rods, provides a rigid, reinforced structure ensuring high mechanical strength. The silicone rubber housing is directly molded onto the metal oxide varistors (MOVs) and the surrounding cage made of FRP rods. This creates a reliable seal that prevents moisture ingress and partial discharges. \nThe MO resistors are not surrounded by a rigid mechanical coating, which is why no critical increases in pressure can occur in the surge arrester in the extremely rare event of an overload. The arc can escape directly through the soft silicone housing without damaging the mechanical structure. No internal parts are ejected in the process. The innovative Siemens Energy cage design is very secure. \nThe silicone rubber is highly hydrophobic and UV-resistant. This keeps any conductive moisture from forming on the surface, and dirt deposits are rendered harmless as a result of the hydrophobic transfer. Silicone is highly fire-retardant and self-extinguishing in the event of fire. These properties ensure the reliable, maintenance-free operation of 3EL surge arresters. They are also lightweight, allowing for easy transport and a variety of installation options. 3EL surge arresters are suitable for use as station or line surge arresters. \nSiemens Energy 3EQ surge arresters with silicone housing and a composite hollow core design are ideally suited for the reliable protection of: \nThe surge arrester with the composite hollow core design uses silicone and fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) as housing materials. The direct molding of the silicone onto the FRP hollow core ensures reliability, while an excellent special sealing of the flanges at both ends of the surge arrester effectively prevents partial discharges and moisture ingress. This guarantees decades of trouble-free operation. \nThe combination of silicone rubber and the fiberglass-reinforced hollow core also allows for outstanding mechanical stability. \nThe surge arrester with the composite hollow core design provides a very high degree of safety: In the event of an overload or the extremely rare case of an arrester short circuit, the arc escapes directly through directional pressure relief devices. \nThe surge arrester can be oriented to minimize the risk of damage to facilities and injuries to people nearby. Internal parts are not ejected, and the housing does not break. \n3EQ surge arresters can be used as station or support insulators. They are ideally suited for areas with the heaviest seismic activity, extremely strong winds and in support functions. \nSiemens Energy 3EP porcelain surge arresters offer outstanding protection against overvoltages in networks of up to 800 kV. \n3EP porcelain surge arresters are ideally suited for the reliable protection of: \nThe excellent sealing system prevents moisture ingress and partial discharges. \nIn the extremely rare event of an overload, the arc can escape directly through the directional pressure relief devices. Strong, high-quality porcelain prevents the ejection of internal parts. The Siemens Energy porcelain design offers extremely safe overload performance. \n3EP porcelain surge arresters are ideal for areas with heavy seismic activity and extremely strong winds. \nDo you have any questions about our high-voltage station arresters?

With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating. By removing waste heat, the heat pump also provides cooling for the electrolyzer, minimizing the need for other cooling equipment.

The hydrogen can be easily stored for times when there is a shortage of renewable energy. At the same time, the heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer to produce heat at temperatures suitable for district heating. In times of renewable energy surplus, thermal power plants can be shut down because they are not needed for electricity or heat production. When heat production is higher than heat demand, the excess heat from the heat pump can be stored in thermal storage facilities. \nThese processes are working together for our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDuring periods of renewable energy shortage and high energy prices, the hydrogen can be fired in a thermal plant (e.g., a hydrogen-ready gas turbine cogeneration plant) to produce electricity and heat. The heat from the thermal storage covers periods of high heat demand but low electricity demand. The integration of renewable energy in heat production helps to decarbonize district heating. The integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution lowers the levelized cost of energy for both hydrogen production and heat production for district heating by minimizing energy losses.  \nElectrolyzer provides an efficiency of about 75%. An integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution increases energy utilization. This calculation is based on a solution with hydrogen production of 1005 kg/h at 80 barg with a heat pump for district heating as mentioned in the table below. Please follow the power flows of the process in the diagram. The energy utilization is increased up to 96% and more. \nAn integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution consists of the PEM electrolyzer (standard configuration for 335 kg/h and 1005 kg/h hydrogen are available), a high-temperature heat pump (8 MWth or 24 MWth; max. achievable temperature for district heating: up to 150°C), the control system and hydrogen as well as heat storage. \nClick on the plus icons to learn more about the different component of our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solutions \nPower-fully efficient \nWaste heat should not be wasted! Our solution increases the energy utilization of green hydrogen production from 75% to 96% or more. The heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer. It raises the temperature level and makes it usable for processes such as district heating. \nPower-fully intelligent \nOur solution provides automated and optimized operation through intelligent control that can manage energy supply and demand for electricity and heat, as well as reserve management. It uses real-time data in an autonomous and coordinated manner to ensure reliable 24/7 operation. \nPower-fully sustainable \nIntegrating renewable energy into heat production decarbonizes district heating.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.\n \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability.

Today’s operators face additional challenges such as: energy transition, effectively managing large amounts of data, cybersecurity threats and tightening legislation. \nOur solutions are tailored to meet the evolving needs of operators globally, taking an integrated approach to the engineering, supply and life cycle optimization of equipment at the heart of midstream assets. We provide complete rotating machinery train solutions, integrated electrical and controls equipment and digital solutions, as well as a comprehensive range of services for support over the entire lifecycle. We are a partner for your energy transition journey, offering a variety of strategies and solutions to reach net zero goals, including integration of energy storage solutions, the production and transportation of hydrogen, and the integration of CO2 capture and compression technologies. \nNatural gas production, processing, transportation and distribution are responsible for a significant proportion of fugitive methane emissions worldwide. Minimizing fugitive methane is critical for reducing its impact on the environment as a potent Green House Gas (GHG). \nIn recent years, oil and gas operators across the supply chain have faced increased pressure to improve efficiency and minimize environmental impacts. To help meet these challenges, the SGT-750 industrial gas turbine has been frequently selected for power generation and mechanical drive applications. Designed to incorporate the size and weight advantages of an aeroderivative gas turbine, the SGT-750 maintains the robustness and flexibility of heavy-duty models. With industry leading fuel-efficiency, single digit emissions down to low part load operation, 68,000 operating hours to a first major overhaul and a service plan with only 17 maintenance days in 17 years, the turbine has become a popular option in oil and gas applications.  \nThe Pipestone Processing Facility, owned by Keyera Partnership, is lowering its carbon footprint with the use of high-efficiency centrifugal compressors and a 40-megawatt industrial gas turbine. The facility, located in Alberta, Canada, also utilizes a refrigeration train that consists of an electric motor-driven DATUM compressor with a variable frequency drive. The project is the first application of the SGT-750 for a gas processing plant in North America. The turbine can achieve single-digit NOₓ emission levels down to a 20% load and the compression train includes a waste heat recovery unit. These factors will enhance processing efficiency and further contribute to reducing the plant’s carbon footprint.   \nMexican midstream operator Fermaca uses three pipeline compressor trains driven by SGT-750 gas turbines to transport natural gas at its El Encino compression station. As an important bridge fuel for the energy transition, the pipeline will transport natural gas from Waha, Texas, to power plants and industrial parks in Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango, as well as to central and western Mexico. This project marks the first installation where an SGT-750 is being used as a mechanical drive unit coupled with our high efficiency pipeline compressors.  \nOur extensive experience in supporting midstream applications all over the world is a testament to the technical capabilities of our equipment, as well as our ability to ensure smooth, on-time delivery and execution.

The HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. \nThe gas turbine is capable of world-class fast cold starts and hot re-starts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages and free thermal expansion of rotor and casing parts during transients. Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), an active clearance control,  ensures robustness and low turbine degradation at start-up. GT ramp-up rate 85 MW/min. \nThe advanced can-annular combustion system with dual fuel capability allows for higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility. 25 premix burners improve the fuel/oxygen mixing. The ACE combustion system allows for GT turn-down to 30% minimum environmental load. \nAll turbine blades and vanes are equipped with an innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating. This leads to higher combined cycle efficiency due to less cooling air consumption and reduced operational costs due to higher blade robustness. \nThe HL-class has been designed to minimize outage times. Rotor de-stacking can easily be done on site thanks to the Hirth-serrated disc assembly. All rotating compressor and turbine blades can be replaced without rotor lift or rotor de-stacking. Turbine blade 1 and turbine blade 4 are removable without cover lift. With 33kEBH service intervals the service concept is very competitive. \nDue to proven and validated package and plant concepts the HL-class can easily be integrated in our power plants for simple cycle or combined cycle operation. This enables fast project execution. More than 50,0000  hours are saved on site due to modularized design and pre-engineered solutions. \nThe new HL-class is based on the reliable engine architecture of the SGT-8000H series with design features that have proved reliability in operation for years:  \nBased on proven design and relying on the vast fleet experience of the SGT-8000H series, the new SGT5-9000HL combines the best of past experience with newly developed technologies. Thus, efficiency and performance are pushed to the next level. \nThe HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. A modular design approach allows for a substantial number of common parts. The  HL-class is designed for high operational flexibility and has a joint DNA with the proven Siemens Energy H-class: Air-cooled 4-stage turbine, steel rotor / hirth serration / single tie bolt design, Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), can-annular combustion system \nCommon parts minimize manufacturing risks and shorten lead times \nWorld-class fast cold starts and hot-restarts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages \nTo achieve top performance and efficiency levels, the HL-class turbines are operating at highest combustion temperatures with an advanced combustion system.An innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating and super-efficient internal cooling features are protecting turbine blades and vanes while reducing the need of cooling air.Additionally, advanced 3D blading leads to higher aero efficiency in the compressor.  A free-standing, internally cooled turbine blade 4 reduces exhaust losses and allows for higher exhaust temperatures to enhance the water-steam cycle. \nfor higher aero efficiency \nfor higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility \nfor better blade robustness and less cooling air consumption \nfor higher power output \nSiemens Energy has re-invented the methodology for plant construction with a modular Power Core™.The Power Core™ consists of prefabricated Siemens Energy Solution Blocks and prefabricated pipe racks. These plug-and-play blocks are fabricated and tested in a controlled manufacturing environment and delivered to site as large modules which can be lifted into place for assembly. This results in increased safety on site, accelerated schedules, less dependence on the availability of skilled local labor and in the end lower project risk. HL-class power plants are based on one or more HL-class gas turbines and can achieve more than 64% efficiency in combind cycle operation: \nSCC5-9000HL 1x1: 880 MW SCC5-9000HL 2x1: 1,760 MW \n All components are designed with high focus on optimized LCOE, highest availability and serviceability.

As a first step, this can be achieved by making fuel usage more efficient. Later, this fossil fuel can be replaced with carbon-free fuel. Alternatively, heat production can also be electrified by using power from renewable energy. Existing heat networks can be transformed fast and at a large scale into cost-effective and flexible low-carbon energy systems. \nThere are several applications that can help you to decarbonize heat networks. At Siemens Energy, we provide tailor-made CHP and Power to Heat (P2H) solutions for residential, commercial, or industrial sectors. \nCHP generates electricity and heat from a single fuel source. Traditional heating plants emit varying amounts of CO2 depending on the fuel used. Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%. Additionally, converting the plant into a GT-powered CHP or a Combined Cycle Power Plant with heat extraction can significantly improve its electrical efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency can be as high as 90% while using as little fuel as possible. \nFind out which gas turbine fits best for your application. \nPower-to-heat (P2H) can be accomplished through heat pumps or electric boilers. Heat pumps utilize waste or environmental heat, raising its temperature with electricity. They produce the same heat using less electricity than electric boilers, leading to lower operational costs. Electric boilers require minimal capital investment and have quick installation. Induction-based technologies or innovative turboheaters are suitable for industrial processes requiring high temperatures. \nExplore our industrial-scale heat pump portfolio \nClean fuels, such as green hydrogen or biofuels, can drastically lower CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for fossil fuels in gas turbines. This is an effective way to future proof a combined cycle power plant and maximize its life cycle. Find out how much carbon footprint you can reduce by burning green hydrogen in your gas turbine. Calculate your carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and cost-savings potential on carbon certificates. \nCalculate your CO₂ emission reduction potential \nAnother decarbonization path is to transform fossil-fired heat generation by switching to sustainably produced biomass in Combined Heat and Power plants. When adding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), biomass- or biofuel-based CHP plants can be further transformed into bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), thus allowing for negative emissions and energy production at the same time.   \nLearn more about our biomass power plant solutions \nFor maximum efficiency, it often makes sense to combine different technologies. To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H). \nAs most of the factors influencing the technology choice depend on the location of the heating network, there is no one-fits-all solution. However, a pre-selection of suitable technologies can be done, based on the temperature level that is required for the specific application. The matrix below shows the temperature level that can be achieved with different technologies. \nContact us today to find the best solution for decarbonizing your heat network! \nRepurposing existing power plants or heating plants can substantially contribute to decarbonizing your assets. A heating plant can be transformed into a cogeneration plant, and a thermal power plant can be turned into a CHP plant. Alternatively, you can convert the complete thermal plant into a Power to Heat application. \nWith our Brownfield transformation approach, you can convert existing assets within a short time frame into a low-carbon facility while re-using the existing infrastructure as much as possible.\n \nPower-to-heat (P2H) systems signal a paradigm shift in the capabilities of low-carbon energy systems. Since heat pumps or electric boilers can be exclusively powered by green electricity, it allows the integration of renewable energy sources in heat energy production—an integration that is both crucial and long overdue. \nBy adjusting their heat output in response to variations in renewable energy generation, power-to-heat systems can also provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Power-to-heat systems convert surplus renewable energy into usable thermal energy for local or central heating and cooling needs.\n \nDue to their high Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat pumps provide low carbon heat. They are completely carbon neutral when powered entirely by renewable energy.  \nHeat can be stored significantly more cost effectively than electricity. The combination of P2H with CHP stabilizes the power market. Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time. At peak heat demand it is possible to operate the heat pump together with the CHP plant. \nA new heat pump to help MVV achieve its goal of decarbonizing district heating in Mannheim, Germany \nReplacement of a Holland Board of Public Works coal plant with a new CHP plant at Holland Energy Park \nBrownfield engine exchange service and modernization of a combned cycle power plant of BASF \nTwo cutting-edge gas turbine packages for a new district heating power plant with an expected fuel efficiency of 93% \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \nThe page with name \"Combined heat and power\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/distributed-power/combined-heat-and-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT5-2000E Heavy-duty gas turbine (50Hz)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/sgt5-2000e.html\" has the following content:\nThe SGT5-2000E gas turbine is a proven, robust engine for the 50 Hz market, used in simple cycle or combined cycle processes, with or without combined heat and power. \nIt is suitable for all load ranges, including peak load, and offers outstanding fuel flexibility: You can use low-calorific gases, gases containing CO₂, H₂S and N₂ or crude oil and other liquid fuels with high viscosity.

When the pipeline content (mix of oil and water) cools down, the temperature is approaching the ambient seawater temperature. \nThis can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius. \nTraditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits.  \nSiemens Energy offers DEH power supply systems to prevent hydrate formation during planned and unplanned process shutdown.  \nOur systems will contribute to a consistent flow of hydrocarbons despite challenging fluid characteristics and temperature conditions at the seabed. The respective modules of the systems may contain power electronic components as well as control and protection units for the topside equipment and subsea pipeline to be installed on the platform deck. \nThe systems are designed to control, compensate and balance the single-phase electrical load that the pipeline and the piggyback cable constitute. Each of the systems is customized to the power requirements and electrical properties of the specified subsea load, in both “heat-up” and “maintain heat” mode. The systems are designed to be optimally tuned at any load condition to ensure an excellent power factor, low harmonic feedback, and to have low negative sequence current - important for minimal impact to the platform power grid. \nAuxiliary systems for fiber-optic temperature monitoring of the piggyback cables are offered optionally, as well as solutions for remote connection to the modules’ control and protection system via a secure internet connection.  \nSiemens Energy has a conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit. \nOur conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit, allows subsea power distribution to multiple ETH loads, and uses components already qualified in the Subsea Power Grid program, together with field-proven topside components, in order to achieve a reliable design.  In combination with other subsea power grid units, like the subsea transformer, even higher degrees of flexibility and customization for specific project requirements can be achieved.   \nSiemens Energy also offers connectivity solutions for ETH applications using the SpecTRON 8 family.    \nLearn more about our ETH SpecTRON 8 solution - Connectors SpecTRON 8  \nThe page with name \"Pipeline Heating\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/direct-electrical-heating.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT6-9000HL Heavy Duty Gas Turbine\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/sgt6-9000hl-heavy-duty-gas-turbine.html\" has the following content:\nSiemens Energy HL-class gas turbines are paving the way to the next level of efficiency and performance. \nDerived from proven Siemens Energy H-class technology in an evolutionary development step, the next generation of Siemens Energy advanced air-cooled gas turbines uses a series of new, but already tested technologies like super-efficient internal cooling features for blades or vanes and an advanced combustion system to increase firing temperature. The result: A technology carrier to the next level with a combined cycle efficiency beyond 64% with a midterm goal of even higher efficiencies. The Siemens Energy HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. \nThe gas turbine is capable of world-class fast cold starts and hot re-starts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages and free thermal expansion of rotor and casing parts during transients. Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), an active clearance control,  ensures robustness and low turbine degradation at start-up. GT ramp-up rate 85 MW/min. \nThe advanced can-annular combustion system with dual fuel capability allows for higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility. 25 premix burners improve the fuel/oxygen mixing. The ACE combustion system allows for GT turn-down to 30% minimum environmental load. \nAll turbine blades and vanes are equipped with an innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating. This leads to higher combined cycle efficiency due to less cooling air consumption and reduced operational costs due to higher blade robustness. \nThe HL-class has been designed to minimize outage times. Rotor de-stacking can easily be done on site thanks to the Hirth-serrated disc assembly. All rotating compressor and turbine blades can be replaced without rotor lift or rotor de-stacking. Turbine blade 1 and turbine blade 4 are removable without cover lift. With 33kEBH service intervals the service concept is very competitive. \nDue to proven and validated package and plant concepts the HL-class can easily be integrated in our power plants for simple cycle or combined cycle operation. This enables fast project execution. More than 50,0000  hours are saved on site due to modularized design and pre-engineered solutions. \nThe new HL-class is based on the reliable engine architecture of the SGT-8000H series with design features that have proved reliability in operation for years:  \nBased on proven design and relying on the vast fleet experience of the SGT-8000H series, the new SGT5-9000HL combines the best of past experience with newly developed technologies. Thus, efficiency and performance are pushed to the next level. \nThe HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. A modular design approach allows for a substantial number of common parts. The  HL-class is designed for high operational flexibility and has a joint DNA with the proven Siemens Energy H-class: Air-cooled 4-stage turbine, steel rotor / hirth serration / single tie bolt design, Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), can-annular combustion system \nCommon parts minimize manufacturing risks and shorten lead times \nWorld-class fast cold starts and hot-restarts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages \nTo achieve top performance and efficiency levels, the HL-class turbines are operating at highest combustion temperatures with an advanced combustion system.An innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating and super-efficient internal cooling features are protecting turbine blades and vanes while reducing the need of cooling air.Additionally, advanced 3D blading leads to higher aero efficiency in the compressor.  A free-standing, internally cooled turbine blade 4 reduces exhaust losses and allows for higher exhaust temperatures to enhance the water-steam cycle. \nfor higher aero efficiency \nfor higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility \nfor better blade robustness and less cooling air consumption \nfor higher power output \nSiemens Energy has re-invented the methodology for plant construction with a modular Power Core™.The Power Core™ consists of prefabricated Siemens Energy Solution Blocks and prefabricated pipe racks. These plug-and-play blocks are fabricated and tested in a controlled manufacturing environment and delivered to site as large modules which can be lifted into place for assembly. This results in increased safety on site, accelerated schedules, less dependence on the availability of skilled local labor and in the end lower project risk. HL-class power plants are based on one or more HL-class gas turbines and can achieve more than 64% efficiency in combind cycle operation: \nSCC5-9000HL 1x1: 880 MW SCC5-9000HL 2x1: 1,760 MW \n All components are designed with high focus on optimized LCOE, highest availability and serviceability. Several service features are supporting this.  \nTremendous service fleet experience and continuous development result in a competitive service concept with 33,000 Equivalent Base Hours (EBH) / 1,250 Equivalent Starts (ES). \nfor reduced down times \nthrough easy burner replacement thanks to innovative robot technology (picture: exemplary application – SGT5-8000H burner replacement) \nThe SGT6-9000HL runs on natural gas, LNG, distillate oil, or other fuels.

With a growing number of high-voltage overhead lines in a fast-changing energy environment, both shunt and series reactors play a key role in stabilizing network systems and increasing grid efficiency. They are available as series reactors, variable and fixed shunt reactors with a rated power from ≤10 MVAr to 300 MVAr (33 kV to 800 kV).  \nReactors from Siemens Energy come with benefits at various levels to help grid operators achieve and maintain a reliable and secure power supply system. For over 100 years, we have closely cooperated with energy providers and grid operators. Drawing on these decades of experience, we have tailored our processes − from consulting to design, from manufacturing to testing and after-sales services − to meet the needs of our customers and their individually customized units. Siemens Energy manufactures the full range of reactors for all customer needs in a variety of application areas. With the increase of renewable and distributed power generation reactors – and variable shunt reactors in particular – play a significant role in today’s energy landscape with its higher fluctuation in power feed-in. Reactors of Siemens Energy are compact and robust with stable performance over the complete service life. Customers can optionally choose features like low-noise/low-loss version, extended 80%-regulation range and green design options. \nWhile fixed shunt reactors are designed for defined system condition and are cost-effective, variable shunt reactors (VSR) offer flexibility and efficiency in grids dealing with fluctuating power flows. VSRs adjust reactor power rating to actual needs, leading to lower losses and noise emissions, making them the ideal choice for networks experiencing continuous fluctuations. \nThe decision to opt for a fixed SHR often has technical reasons, but the - admittedly more substantial - investment in a variable shunt reactor does pay off: With increasing load fixed shunt reactors will overcompensate the voltage increase, resulting in an overall voltage drops, while variable shunt reactors always compensate accurately and adjust to the current load situation. \nWith Siemens Energy, you are not just investing in a product but a partnership. We offer in-house grid consulting to help you find the most cost-efficient solution for your grid. Our reactors are manufactured under the highest quality standards and are designed to be compact, resulting in lower costs for substation construction and increased grid capacity. \nSiemens Energy prides itself on a long-standing history of providing reliable and precision-engineered solutions. Our reactor design process is powered by cutting-edge software and simulation tools, ensuring a high success rate right from the first production run. With our reactors, you can maximize grid efficiency, thereby making Siemens Energy your trusted ally in navigating the global energy transition. \nThe page with name \"Reactors\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/reactors.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Hydrogen Decarbonization Calculator\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/hydrogen/hydrogen-decarb-calculator.html\" has the following content:\nLet Siemens Energy help you reach your decarbonization targets.

Instead of building new lines to provide sufficient transmission capacity, it’s often better to use our flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) technology to increase the transmission capacity. Both newly built transmission lines and existing systems benefit from Siemens Energy’ FSC which is part of the series compensation (SC) solutions that also help to improve the quality and stability of power transmission lines. \nInnovative series compensation technology provides higher transmission capacities for existing long-distance AC transmission lines and increased grid stability without the costs and time-requirement of building new lines. \nFor decades, fixed series capacitor (FSC) technology from Siemens Energy has improved grid stability and contributed to the optimal utilization of transmission lines. Transmission system operators around the world have already benefited from solutions that were tailored to their specific requirements. Among the main benefits of FSC are the reduction of line voltage drops, limitation of load-dependent drops, and a reduction of the transmission angle. \nIncreased maximum capacity \nFixed series capacitor expands the transmission capacity of lines by compensating the impedance of the overhead line. It’s a cost-efficient way to achieve larger transmission capacities instead of building new lines. \nIncreased grid stability \nWith fixed series compensation, it’s possible to provide system stability for bulk power transmission and long transmission lines by reducing voltage drops at the point of connection. This increases overall grid stability. \nEconomical solution \nThe fixed series capacitors are the most cost-efficient solution. Their simple, proven and robust technology supports transmission system operators by optimizing power transmission and increasing transmission capacity. Siemens Energy is proud to reiterate: All major components are sourced in-house. \nThe amount of power that can be transferred with long overhead transmission lines is limited by the impedance that can lead to voltage drops. For decades, fixed series compensation is the proven solution to maintain a minimum voltage profile and maximize utilization of transmission lines.  \nIt works by connecting a capacitor bank in series with the transmission line to partially compensate the inductive impedance of the line while also increasing the voltage at the point of connection. The capacitors are protected by metal-oxide varistors (MOV) and – in case of a fault – by tripping the FSC and closing the bypass breaker. For instant protection, a triggered spark gap bypasses capacitors and MOVs within less than 1 ms. Even gap-less solutions are possible, provided that local requirements match. Due to this complexity Siemens Energy recommends and offers individually designed solutions with fixed series capacitors. \nThe page with name \"Fixed series capacitor (FSC)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/fixed-series-capacitor.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Services\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/service-offerings.html\" has the following content:\nWe support companies and countries to reduce emissions across the energy landscape – for a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy system \nTo reach net zero we need to decarbonize energy.

The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field. \nDubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world. \nSince the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats. \nThe basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency. \nWith our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling. \nParabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam. \nThe parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants. \nA circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine. \nThe advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field. This means that higher working fluid temperatures in the receiver (up to 1000°C) and better steam parameters are feasible, even supercritical steam is expected. \nThe number of concentrated solar power plants has increased tremendously in the past ten years. Today we see many different regimes of operations, each of which poses a different challenge to power generation equipment. The design of each steam turbine is adapted to these challenges. \nExamples for the regimes of operation for a solarthermal power plant, with a power output of 50 MW: \nAs market leader in industrial steam turbines, we command a comprehensive product portfolio for solar thermal plants, covering the full range from 1.5 MW to more than 250 MW. \nOptimized for challenging cycle \nCSP plants require steam turbines which are optimized for their complex and challenging cycle conditions. Bearing in mind that efficiency and total cost of ownership are key to any investment decision, we incorporate operational experience into extensive R&D and engineering activities to adapt the turbines to the specific requirements of the CSP technology. \nExcellent daily start-up solutions \nDay and night cycle often requires a large number of starts and fast daily startup capabilities from CSP steam turbines. When focusing on annual power production, the short start-up times of the turbines are of great benefit to the CSP plant owner. Daily cycling and temperature variations require special attention. \nReheat improves efficiency \nReheat solutions improve efficiency and reduce problems with erosion/corrosion and moisture in the LP turbine. Our steam turbines meet all customer requirements for economic installation and operation and provide excellent flexibility for all cycling conditions. The turbines are suitable for higher steam parameters and can be operated in non-reheat, single reheat and double reheat cycles. \nReliable steam turbine technology \nOur steam turbines are tailored to the customer requirements and shipped assembled for easy installation at site. This reduces time and manpower in the installation phase. All steam turbines are available with axial or radial exhaust and suitable for air- and water-cooled plants. \nWe provide optimal instrumentation and controls (I&C) design for CSP & Hybrid-PV plants for achieving the full dispatchability of solar energy power plants.

It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas. Only around 40% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from power generation which can be decarbonized via electrification. The other 60% of CO2 emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be decarbonized via sector coupling, using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition. \nDiscover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video! \nElyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors. \nWith our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition.

As a molecule (H2), it occurs only in small amounts in nature and it is mainly chemically bound, such as H2O. \nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. 90 percent of all atoms are hydrogen atoms. They add up to three quarters of the total mass in the universe. \nHydrogen converts into a liquid at minus 253 ºC. \nHydrogen has the highest energy density of all conventional fuels by mass: almost three times as high as that of gasoline or diesel. That is one of the reasons why hydrogen is used as fuel for space travel. \nH2 Higher  Heating  Value: 39.4 kWh/kg; H2 Lower Heating  Value: 33.3 kWh/kg \nBy combusting hydrogen, it delivers heat. Used in fuel cells, hydrogen is converted electrochemically  to electrical energy. \nHydrogen has been produced and used for more than 200 years. Experience shows that hydrogen can be stored, distributed and converted safely. As early as 1808, the first large-scale use of hydrogen was established for the street lighting system in London. \nHydrogen (H2) can be produced in different ways. For the moment more than 95% of the hydrogen worldwide is produced from hydrocarbons while producing and emitting harmful CO2. A more modern and ecofriendly technology for CO2 neutral production of hydrogen can be offered by electrolysis of water. \nHydrogen can be produced from hydrocarbons by steam reforming of natural gas - often referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR), coal gasification and from an electrolysis process of water (H2O). \nHydrogen can be stored in tanks as a compressed gas or as a liquid. Hydrogen can also be stored in caverns or in the natural gas grid for different applications and if the grid fulfils all technological requirements. \nThe volumetric energy density of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is approximately one third of traditional fuels. The volumetric energy density can be increased by compression or liquefaction of the hydrogen gas to store and transport a greater amount of hydrogen. \nFor hydrogen-powered vehicles, an industry standard of 300 to 700 bar has been established. Vehicles for the transport of compressed hydrogen, so called “tankers”, usually working with a maximum pressure of 200 bar. \nHydrogen can be transported as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid. Today, the two main methods for transporting hydrogen (primarily in a gaseous state) are via tanker e.g. tube trailer for road transportation and in gas pipelines (for short distance). \nHydrogen is a non-toxic clear gas. It is not poisonous, has no taste or odor. Using hydrogen as a fuel source with fuel cells does not create fumes, pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide or emit nitrogen oxides. \nIt is not inherently more dangerous than other fuel sources.  Hydrogen is flammable and must be handled with care, just like other flammable fuels. To ignite, the hydrogen must be combined with an additional oxidizing agent (air, pure oxygen, chlorine, etc.) in a specific  concentration and an ignition source (a spark). If, in a worst-case scenario, the hydrogen ignites, it burns upwards very quickly. It creates no dangerous heat radiation above the accident site, as petrol or kerosene do. \nThe facilities are designed to be permanently leak proof. Flange connections are designed especially for hydrogen and the number of detachable connections are minimized. Furthermore, in buildings a steady air exchange is ensured and the facilities are equipped with safety valves and pressure reliefs. Additionally explosion prevention zones are designated. In these zones, electrical and other equipment needs to be in accordance with 2014/34/EU (ATEX Directive). \nNo. Hydrogen can be safely handled and stored as well as transported. The industrial gas industry has done so for over a century. \nIn contrast to gasoline and natural gas, hydrogen gas has significant buoyancy in atmospheric conditions due to its low density, any leaking hydrogen gas ascends immediately and disperses, which reduces the risk of an ignition in open air. \nWater gets split into its components hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrical current. \nElectrolysis processes can be categorized as follows: alkaline electrolysis with liquid alkaline electrolytes, acidic electrolysis with a solid polymer electrolyte (as PEM) and high temperature electrolysis with a solid oxide as electrolyte. \nPEM electrolysis and alkaline electrolysis systems are available at an industrial scale. The solid oxide electrolysis technology is in an early development phase. \nPEM is the abbreviation for proton exchange membrane. This membrane is a crucial part of the electrolytic cell in a PEM-electrolyzer. The membrane separates the anode, where the oxygen is collected, and the cathode, where the hydrogen gas is generated. \nThe type of the ions which closes the electric circuit \n10 liter demineralized water is needed for 1kg of hydrogen. \nOn average 50kWh are necessary to produce 1kg of hydrogen, depending on the efficiency of the electrolyzer and operation mode. \nThe hydrogen market is divided in three sectors. Mobility, energy and industry with industry being by far the largest consumer today (~90%). In the future a redistribution towards the mobility and energy sector is expected . \nToday, hydrogen is an important industrial gas, i.e. for the refining of fuels, for the production of fertilizer and methanol, for the hydrogenation of fats, for steel production, metal processing, as well as in the production of flat glass. \nLess than 1kg of hydrogen is needed per 100km. \nPassenger car or light duty vehicle fueling takes 3 to 5 minutes. \nHydrogen enables the long-term storage of large quantities of surplus renewable energy. It is allows new ways to use green electricity, i.e. by using hydrogen as substitute for natural gas by feeding it into existing pipelines, as fuel for fuel-cell vehicles or power plants, or as feedstock for the hydrogen processing industry. It opens the possibility to connect energy generation with the industry and mobility sectors, the so called “sector coupling”. \nNo. Hydrogen will become a substantial and permanent element of a sustainable energy industry. \nIn the future, hydrogen will be produced to a greater extent using electricity from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, biogas and various fuels like solid biomass will help to produce green hydrogen in the future. \n‘Green’ hydrogen is sourced by 100% renewable energy. That means that the needed energy to produce hydrogen by electrolysis has emitted zero emissions. Hydrogen produced from fossil fuels releasing emissions such as CO2, may be referred to as ‘grey’ or ‘brown’ hydrogen. If the emitted carbon dioxide is captured, stored (carbon capture storage) and re-used, it is often called ‘blue’ hydrogen. \nThe page with name \"Green hydrogen production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/hydrogen-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"High speed busbar transfer systems (Omnivise electrical solutions)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/omnivise-digital-solutions/omnivise-electrical-solutions/electricals-hs-busbar.html\" has the following content:\nHigh speed busbar transfer systems secure a fast and reliable change-over between the main and the back-up power supply sources when the availability of the auxiliary power supply is crucial. \nOur compact high speed busbar transfer system (HSBT-Compact) based on the SIPROTEC 6MD85 bay controller allows interruption-free or a short currentless gap transfer between two or three incoming feeders of medium voltage switchgears.

In the context of heat and power generation, the need for flexibility and self-reliance in fuel choices is becoming increasingly crucial. Green fuels can be one solution. \nHow can we build a flexible and sustainable energy system with gas turbines, renewable energy sources and energy storage? As power from solar and wind is volatile and doesn’t always match the energy demand, hydrogen produced from these green energy sources can be used as an energy storage solution and used as fuel in the gas turbines to balance the grid. \n... aspects of distributed power generation that you would never have thought might influence your business now or in the near future. \nFirst introduced in Singapore in 1975, such zones are nowadays located in cities worldwide. Car traffic limitations, tree planting. What else? Look at the sidewalk. Do you notice any ventilation grids? There might be a diesel backup engine of a hospital, office or data center beneath your feet. \nEven modern, diesel-fueled backup generators of Tier-4 standards could lead to high concentrations of poisonous exhaust plumes in urban street canyons which may explain why gas turbines, and batteries have become the preferred backup power source for many data centers.  \nThe World Bank has announced the Thirsty Energy Initiative. The World Energy Council has published The Road to Resilience Report - Managing the Risks of the energy-water-food nexus. In April 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation presented the 2-year forecast which could lead to the first water shortage declaration in the Western United States. \nLet´s save water for drinking. Combine a gas turbine with Organic Rankin Cycle (ORC) technology for waste heat recovery without water in a  Heat ReCycle powerplant. Soon, cutting-edge technology will allow upgrading the gas turbine to burn 100% hydrogen in DLE (dry low emissions).  \nYou stand at the forefront of the energy transition.

The interests of operators and investors, on the one hand, and those of utilities and grids, on the other, are becoming more closely aligned. This is because ensuring a stable power supply as well as the financial success of the power plant are common goals.  \nThe biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built. It will apply novel process innovations to sustainably convert 100 percent wood into bio-based mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), mono-propylene glycol (MPG) as well as renewable functional fillers (RFF).  \nWith more widespread environmental awareness and the resultant striving for “green” lifestyles, biomass energy for both industry and electricity providers is a reliable – and sustainable – source of baseload power. \nIt also helps in meeting environmental targets, absorbing more CO₂ than it emits, and efficient equipment used in power generation leads to fewer emissions at the plant site. \nBiomass is a relatively cheap base load and, depending on the local regulations, surplus electricity produced from it can be fed back to the grid, making it even more economically viable. \nInstalling a biomass power plant to burn the on-site waste that occurs as a by-product of industrial processes closes the factory input cycle. \nIt also eliminates the need for waste disposal, lowers energy costs and maintains a high availability of the power supply. \nIncinerating renewables is thus a further step toward sustainability and toward a closed-cycle economy. These by-products need no additional processing, further strengthening the financial feasibility of the biomass plant. \nThe possibility of running a biomass plant on diverse feedstocks adds to the viability of such projects while ensuring the availability of the fuel supply. \nApart from achieving maximum output with a minimum of life-cycle costs, another decisive economic factor is the need for appropriate frameworks already in the country concerned, regulating such variables as electricity prices, the level of tipping tax, and funding. \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint.\n \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint. \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service.\n \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service. \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population.\n \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population. \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications.\n \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications. \nCapturing the potential of Vietnam biomass energy growth with tailor made high-efficiency steam turbines \nIndustries producing a large amount of process (biomass) waste can convert it into carbon-neutral energy to power their facilities or sell into the grid for additional revenue. \nReheat solutions significantly increase the overall efficiency of a biomass plant and are therefore an optimal solution to produce more energy without having to use more fuel. \nCo-generation with high-tech steam turbines and generators in sugar production. \nDownload the white paper \nPartnering with an experienced equipment manufacturer is an important step toward commissioning a new biomass plant. \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \nSiemens Energy achieves all annual goals and sets new targets for 2028 \nEarnings Release Q4 FY 2024: Siemens Energy achieves all annual goals and sets new targets for 2028 \nAd-hoc - Siemens Energy AG raises mid-term targets for fiscal year 2028 \nThe page with name \"Biomass\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/biomass-to-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Food and beverage / palm oil\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/food-beverage-and-palm-oil-gas-turbines.html\" has the following content:\nThese gas turbines from our portfolio are best suited for food and beverage / sugar and ethanol / palm oil applications and have a track record of successful reference cases.

Today’s emerging power systems are dominated by converter connected renewable power producers which are susceptible to decreased short circuit power and system inertia, making them more sensitive to electrical faults and sudden load imbalances. Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues. \nSynchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid. \nA synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events.  \nMore than 1,000 SGen-100A-2P/SGen-1000A generators are in commercial operation around the globe. \nCustomer: Power MachinesPower output: 227 MW\nApparent power: 227 MVA\nTerminal voltage: 15.75 kV\nFrequency: 50 HzScope: 1 x SGT5-4000F gas turbine, 1 x SGen5-1000A generator, and SPPA-T3000 I&C system\n \nOriginal OEM: BrushPower output: 3 x 105 MVA\nFrequency: 60 Hz\nTerminal voltage: 11 kVScope: SGen-100A-2P generator\n \nModernization and upgrade of 30years old generator (oOEM)Revamped direction of rotation optimizing the flow side inlet channels in the area of the rotor windingAdjusted dimensioning of individual components for higher currents and modified the base frame. \nThe page with name \"SGen-1000A generator series\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgen-100a.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Onshore pipeline gas turbines\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/onshore-pipeline-gas-turbines.html\" has the following content:\nThe page with name \"Onshore pipeline gas turbines\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/onshore-pipeline-gas-turbines.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT-800\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/sgt-800.html\" has the following content:\nWith a proven, long-term track record of successful installations around the world, the SGT-800 gas turbine is an excellent choice for both industrial power generation and oil and gas applications. \nIt will meet your requirements for efficiency, reliability and environmental compatibility, offering low lifecycle costs and the best possible return on investment.

With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating. By removing waste heat, the heat pump also provides cooling for the electrolyzer, minimizing the need for other cooling equipment.  Click on the plus buttons below to explore more about our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDiscover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video! \nElyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors. \nWith our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition.

The hydrogen can be easily stored for times when there is a shortage of renewable energy. At the same time, the heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer to produce heat at temperatures suitable for district heating. In times of renewable energy surplus, thermal power plants can be shut down because they are not needed for electricity or heat production. When heat production is higher than heat demand, the excess heat from the heat pump can be stored in thermal storage facilities. \nThese processes are working together for our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDuring periods of renewable energy shortage and high energy prices, the hydrogen can be fired in a thermal plant (e.g., a hydrogen-ready gas turbine cogeneration plant) to produce electricity and heat. The heat from the thermal storage covers periods of high heat demand but low electricity demand. The integration of renewable energy in heat production helps to decarbonize district heating. The integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution lowers the levelized cost of energy for both hydrogen production and heat production for district heating by minimizing energy losses.  \nElectrolyzer provides an efficiency of about 75%. An integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution increases energy utilization. This calculation is based on a solution with hydrogen production of 1005 kg/h at 80 barg with a heat pump for district heating as mentioned in the table below. Please follow the power flows of the process in the diagram. The energy utilization is increased up to 96% and more. \nAn integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution consists of the PEM electrolyzer (standard configuration for 335 kg/h and 1005 kg/h hydrogen are available), a high-temperature heat pump (8 MWth or 24 MWth; max. achievable temperature for district heating: up to 150°C), the control system and hydrogen as well as heat storage. \nClick on the plus icons to learn more about the different component of our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solutions \nPower-fully efficient \nWaste heat should not be wasted! Our solution increases the energy utilization of green hydrogen production from 75% to 96% or more. The heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer.

They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do. \nAs one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours.  \nDuring the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat.  \nLearn more about transforming heat production \nA new high-temperature industrial heat pump for the cooling center at Potsdamer Platz \nThe new river heat pump from MVV supplies climate-friendly heat from Rhine water to around 3,500 households - One of the largest heat pumps of its kind in Europe. \nFind out more about the MVV Mannheim, Germany \nHeat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. \nSiemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids.

As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​ \nThe ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​ \nStaying below allowed voltage fluctuations​ \nPower system equipment and loads require regulated voltage for proper operation. ​ \nStaying below critical frequency levels​ \nFrequency drift caused by fluctuations in generation or load must be mitigated. ​ \nLack of inertia​  \nAll generation resources must synchronize and remain synchronized through network disturbances.​ \nEmergency reaction​ \nSystem restoration, process of black starting and restoring the power system following a major outage.​ \nMost power electronic systems today use grid following (GFL) inverter controls. Due to their widespread use and growing installed capacity, it is important to understand the characteristics, dynamic behavior and potential contribution to grid reliability of these inverters. Both grid-forming and grid-following controls aim to supply active and reactive power to the grid.

Optimally protected by its cast-resin enclosure against normal and harsh environmental conditions, this maintenance-free transformer enables reliable operation while reducing total costs of ownership.  \nOur latest, innovative dry-type transformer, CAREPOLE was selected for 2022 EUISSCA Sustainable Supply Chain Award! CAREPOLE is an eco-friendly alternative for safer and more reliable distribution grids. \nAre you in need of a reliable, digital (Sensformer), eco-friendly and durable cast-resin transformer? We have an answer for you: CAREPOLE. \nCAREPOLE was developed by Siemens Energy for your overhead distribution line networks. CAREPOLE answers the challenges which transformers can possibly meet. Its windings are sealed with cast resin under vacuum, separated from the core, and the insulation is solid and resist the dielectric loads in the distribution network. The cast resin also protects your unit against severe weather conditions. High- and low-voltage bushings are cast in one piece with the windings. This technical design makes CAREPOLE especially reliable and unsusceptible to failures. Do you need an off-load tap changer? We can provide one near one of the top high-voltage bushings. It is set via a patented tap panel when the transformer is de-energized. \nWeatherproof design \nYour CAREPOLE withstands any weather conditions and ensures a reliable operation. The winding surfaces and core are in direct contact with the ambient air, resulting in efficient natural heat exchange. The frame surrounding the core creates a solid mechanical structure that protects the unit against corrosion and direct sunlight. The frame also serves as a lifting and fastening mechanism for the transformer. A special manufacturing process and advanced sealing compound ensure lownoise operation and perfect contact between frame and core. The core is wound from highquality electrical steel. The solid insulation of CAREPOLE is stable under all weather conditions and prevents moisture from penetrating the windings and core. \nOverload and short circuit capability \nCAREPOLE can withstand higher temperatures than liquid-filled transformers, due to the solid insulation. Accordingly, CAREPOLE units can be overloaded for longer periods of peak demand and can better withstand short-circuit effects. \nOne key factor of the energy market is sustainability. CAREPOLE makes power distribution grids safer and more environmentally friendly because it operates without flammable mineral oil-based insulating fluids. The cast resin used as insulation and for the body of the transformer has excellent electrical and mechanical properties, and is environmentally friendly and self­extinguishing. CAREPOLE does not pose any risk to water sources or nature reserves caused by oil leaks, tank explosions, soil contamination or fires in the event of a fault. Besides, CAREPOLE does not lose any fuel in the case of an external fire. These features can reduce the costs of liability insurance. They also increase the reliability of the distribution grid. \nCAREPOLE can be ordered with ready-to-use sensors, allowing you to perform your own monitoring. The connectivity system securely transmits operational data to an advanced analytics and visualization platform, providing you real-time insights into asset health and fleet status. With these digital features, potential failures can be quickly identified and addressed. You may even be able to prevent issues by detecting operational irregularities at an early stage. This transparency provided by CAREPOLE increases the reliability of your distribution grid, enabling smarter and more efficient operation. \nLearn more about our digital portfolio \nMaintenance-free \nCAREPOLE is very efficient in operation, and power loss is reduced to an absolute minimum. CAREPOLE is nearly maintenance- free, so your maintenance costs are negligible. Service activities are limited to checking the installation, vegetation conditions and wildlife management.

These factors can cause stability problems in the HV-grid (reduction of short circuit power/ inertia and voltage dip stability) which might result in a blackout. In order to prevent this, power stations with black start capabilities are required, while synchronous condensers can supply power during short circuits, and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control.  \nA synchronous condenser is a generator without a prime mover from a gas or steam turbine. It stabilizes the grid in changing reactive power demands. The rotating mass and the dynamic generation of reactive power stands for the high advantages of this product. The main benefits of a synchronous condenser are frequency stabilization and power supply during short circuits.  \nAny existing power plant generator type can be converted into a synchronous condenser. It can supply the grid with short circuit power and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control. Synchronous condensers are designed to stabilize frequency and maintain voltage even over long distances.  \nThey can generate electricity during dynamic peak demands and are able to build up the grid after a black-out. The project time for converting a plant is usually less than 12 months. The solution allows the use of existing assets and offers a very short return on investment (ROI). \n Minimum costs due to re-use of the existing generator and relevant auxiliary systems. Written-off assets can be reactivated. \n Extended lifetime of a power plant generates additional revenue. \n Decreased risk of blackouts as grid is in an optimum range of operation  \nBlack start capabilities can be built by using an independent power source to restore the plant's auxiliary systems without an external source of supply. \nSuitable technologies are: \n  The process begins with a feasibility study in which the main generator capabilities and grid requirements are assessed. The next steps include integrating the new power source into the plant and making necessary modifications to the existing installation. \n Availability to start-up the power plant without an external power supply   \n Capability to help restore power to a national grid in the event of a total or partial shutdown   \n Provision of start-up power to other power stations as the system restoration progresses   \n Additional revenues received directly from the TSOs can help increase plant profitability through additional functionality and revenue opportunities and avoid the closing down of the plant   \n Avoidance of huge production losses due to blackouts and equipment being unavailable   \n    \nWe appreciate your interest in our products.

In addition to the traditional need to reliably, safely, and economically distribute electricity from the generator or incoming grid down to the consumers, there are new emerging challenges, including the need to implement governmental directives to save power, and to utilize the growing amount of renewable energy that's being fed into the grid, which is making grid control increasingly complex. The latter can result in voltage fluctuations and even cause plant downtime. SIPAPER Power allows you to safely and reliably engineer, plan, and realize your factory power distribution system while providing you with the tools to meet today's new demands and challenges. \nAt Progroup Paper AG’s paper factory of in Sandersdorf- Brehna, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, one of the most modern paper machines (PM3) is producing high-quality containerboard from wastepaper. We supply the power distribution and electrification, including the Sipaper DCS APL process control system based on Simatic PCS 7, as well as a multi-motor drive solution based on gearless drives with Sipaper Drives APL Standard. \nA pulp and paper mill places intensive demands on electricity supply and power management: High electricity loads must be distributed to different energy consumers safely, reliably, and economically. To satisfy these requirements with maximum efficiency, SIPAPER Power acts as a fully integrated electricity supply and power management system in combination with PCS 7 Power Control. It all starts at the planning stage of your paper mill’s new power network with the high, medium, and low voltage switchgear. \nSIPAPER Power performs everything – from controlling supply and distribution to open- and closed-loop control of all your loads. It's a fully integrated power distribution and management system for planning and monitoring the power supply for the complete process chain in your paper factory. This also includes a power supply for black starts and emergency power operation. In conjunction with intelligent control and switching devices and our integrated communications network, SIPAPER Power offers the right technical solutions for all of your requirements: high availability, adequate supply capacity, expandability and scalability, consistently high power quality, and environmental compatibility. It goes without saying that it's also economical, saves resources, and is easy to operate. \nSIPAPER Power includes all the necessary components to build a complex power distribution system for your mill, including power and distribution transformers, HV, MV, and LV switchgear in AIS or GIS versions, and appropriate protection systems. In addition a fully integrated energy management system (EMS/SCADA) based on Simatic PCS 7 provides you with all the functions you need to reliably monitor and operate  your mill distribution system. The EMS also includes an intelligent load management module that accurately determines the required loads to be shed and a generator management system (GMS) that optimizes your profits by running the generators in the most efficient range. \nWith SIPAPER Power you benefit from a dual energy-saving concept. First, we implement energy-efficient components that precisely match your requirements: for example, avoiding unnecessary over-rating that makes the components work in an inefficient range. Second, you'll benefit from the EMS/SCADA system that not only offers high transparency by monitoring and controlling the energy flows but also contributes to the overall optimization of energy resources with its generator management system (GMS) – by optimizing the generators to run in the most efficient range and monitoring the automatic load balancing of the turbine generator sets. \nThanks to sophisticated power control technology, SIPAPER Power gives you an overview of all processes in your electrical installations at all times and provides you with essential service information. The system monitors and records all switching processes throughout your entire factory using smart devices like Simocode®, Siprotec control, and fiber-optic networks. This allows you to predict load requirements and inform the operator, or take action to prevent the mill's power demand from rising to unacceptably high load peaks that result in extra charges. \nSIPAPER Power stands for power supply solutions from a single source – fully integrated and coordinated, across all voltage levels, and over the entire lifecycle. The network design starts with the collection of all relevant mill data, including consumer power requirements, starting characteristics of large drives, short-circuit capacity of all components, and grid parameters. Other criteria need to be considered in the engineering,for example, emergency and back-up concepts, mill availability and grid requirements. Finally to verify the mill's design and optimize the recovery time after a mill network or grid supply fault, dynamic network simulations based on fault scenarios are created to guarantee maximum reliability. \nOur Industry Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle, and allow you to exploit the opportunities of digitalization while reducing your total cost of ownership. \nWith our SIPAPER solutions, we help ensure success in the fiber industry worldwide. \nAny questions about energy systems?

Among other things, this means our proven Omnivise T3000 control system security protection will be enhanced with Tenable OT Security at the core. \nSiemens Energy and National Academic and Non-profit Partners announced a new Cybersecurity & Industrial Infrastructure Security Apprenticeship Program (CIISAp). \nBlog: Building the Next Generation of Industrial Cyber Defenders \nEos.ii™ is the first AI-based monitoring and detection platform that can serve as the foundation for securing industrial IoT in an era of persistent cyberattacks \nHere's why: \nEnergy companies increasingly recognize that their likelihood of being attacked is nearly 100% and that they must strengthen their agility and resiliency so they can respond when - not if - they are attacked. \nGovernments are responding to the growing cyber threat by rolling out comprehensive critical infrastructure regulations. But there is a difference between being compliant and being secure. \nIncreased connectivity, automation, and data-driven operations makes a strong cybersecurity program essential. \nSiemens Energy, Saudi Aramco and the World Economic Forum launched a cybersecurity playbook for the oil and gas industry. The report, “Cyber Resilience in the Oil and Gas Industry Playbook”, establishes a blueprint for boards and business leaders to evaluate cyber risk and enhance cyber resilience across the industry. \nEos.ii™ empowers CISOs and SOCs with the platform and insights needed to scale up security to meet the demands of IoT business models. It offers unmatched capabilities to help energy and critical infrastructure organizations build and maintain robust, adaptable, and resilient defenses in a fast-moving and competitive IoT future. \nManaged Detection and Response (MDR) powered by Eos.ii™ is an AI-based service, powered by Siemens Energy’s revolutionary monitoring platform. It provides energy companies with the visibility and context to shine a light into industrial operating environment to stop attacks before they occur. \nThis white paper offers an example of an attack against a fictional electric utility, as it manages an unfolding crisis and illustrates how incident response planning can make a difference in reaching the least disruptive outcome. \nWind farm developers, owners, and operators share an interest in cybersecurity risk manage ment strategies that account for the full life cycle of these assets. To ensure secure reliable renewable power delivery, offshore wind farms should be built and operated with a secure by design approach, with systems-level integration in mind, and with the understanding that the threat environment will continue to evolve long after construction is complete.  \nThis MIT Technology Review report gathers insights from leading practitioners in the oil and gas sector to better understand how global companies are applying advanced digital technologies to both improve efficiency and protect themselves from cyberattacks — and why AI is the key to unlocking and securing the energy transition. \nThis report from the Ponemon Institute highlights the unique cybersecurity requirements for  for the Utility industry. \nIn conjunction with the Ponemon Institute, this report delves into the cyber readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East. \nLearn how US companies in the oil and gas industry are addressing cybersecurity risks in the operational technology (OT) environment. \nOur offering:\nGap analysis \nWhat you will get:\nFindings report that includes both a critical gap summary and a roadmap for recommended remediation \nOur offering:\nIncident response planning and testing \nWhat you will get:\nDetailed plan on how to respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including emergency procedures, roles, and resources \nOur offering:\nFirewall assessment and patch management \nWhat you will get:\nFindings and recommendations for heightened security; malware pattern updates and management \nOur offering:\nSecurity event monitoring system \nWhat you will get:\nReal-time monitoring by collecting and parsing security logs \nOur broad portfolio combines leading industry technologies and tools with expert know-how \nSiemens Energy, along with its technology partner Darktrace, brings real-time anomaly detection to the industrial OT environment.

We provide technical support for designing, deploying, and enabling Tenable's unique software on the control system network to provide a complete picture across the network. \nPlant managers often lack an up-to-date, comprehensive asset inventory of all connected assets. Siemens Energy, in conjunction with PAS™, helps our customers meet this challenge with automated Cyber Asset Management. This includes configuration change management and advice on potential cybersecurity threats. \nMany energy companies keep their networks unconnected because they believe this makes them cyber secure. This misguided strategy will fall victim to more successful attacks, from inside and outside. Connectivity gives you visibility which provides insight. \nMany companies do not know what assets and devices exist on their OT networks. \nThis limits their understanding of where their infrastructure is most vulnerable. \nMost energy companies have focused on building up their IT cyber capabilities. But these cannot be simply deployed into the OT environment because of differences in the systems, data, devices, and critical dependencies. Because of this inattention to OT, cybersecurity experts who can secure complex, aging, and interdependent infra-structure are hard to find. \nOT systems are older than IT systems. OT equipment, which can last decades, is often developed with proprietary systems that have exposures and vulnerabilities difficult to protect. \nEven if a company detects a potential intrusion into its OT cybersecurity environment, it may lack the plans or capabilities to respond effectively. \nCyber solutions must apply across multiple vendors to provide a single, seamless cyber program. \nIf you say “yes” to one or more of the questions above, you are not alone. For energy companies, the probability of a cyber attack is nearly 100%.   \nOvercoming the fear of connectivity is essential because the benefits of digitalization are too great. Organizations must focus on agility and resiliency so they can respond when – not if – they are attacked. \nWe combine our deep OT know-how with cutting-edge technology from selected partners to provide end-to-end solutions for every step in our customers' cybersecurity journey. \nThe page with name \"Cybersecurity for Energy\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/service-offerings/digital-services/cybersecurity.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Generators in Utilities\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/utility-generators.html\" has the following content:\nWith our comprehensive portfolio of reliable Siemens Energy generator service products, we can provide you with solutions that are tailor-made to your specific needs.

We are knowledgeable of potential turbine-generator issues through significant fleet experience and have developed an enormous backlog of field processes, procedures, tooling and trained personnel to quickly address them. \nIn the current state of the energy market utility operators are in need of generators with resilience to meet the demands of generator operational flexibility. \nSiemens Energy generators have demonstrated a long service life, however the life of the generator is subject to normal aging processes which can manifest differently depending on the generator model and operational mode. \nIn today’s operating grid demands, normal aging processes can be exacerbated and accelerated by changes in operating modes, with many startup and shutdowns, frequent turning gear operation in standby mode and fast load changes in the part load range, which can apply greater stress to the individual generator components. \nComplete replacement is in some cases the more cost-effective alternative. A detailed cost/benefit analysis can help you decide if and when an investment in a new generator is economically beneficial compared to maintenance and service expenditures for the current generator. Siemens Energy can provide a matching generator for almost all generator types and configurations. \nSpecifically designed to replace smaller hydrogen- or water-cooled generator, the air-cooled Footprint™ generator is an easy to implement solution in which the existing foundations and interfaces can be used wherever possible. \nDetailed information about our Footprint™ concept \nWhen the power output of the turbine is increased, the generator capability needs to be adapted accordingly. Using specifically developed analysis measures, our Siemens Energy experts can quickly assess various options for uprating your generator and provide an individual proposal. \nSiemens Energy can offer the following measures for uprating your generator: \nThe continuously growing renewables share as well as volatile grids can have a significant impact on the synchronous condenser power production equipment and also on the transmission system operation. The consequences can be multifaceted. Remaining fossil units may be highly cycled and the energy flow in the transmission system complex. At the same time, the stability of a converter dominated transmission system is challenging. The frequency and voltage control as well as fault ride through capability can require installation of new additional equipment for stable and safe grid operation. \nA synchronous condenser is a turbo generator without turbines, connected to the grid via unit transformer, that can be implemented by one of the following options: \nIn power plants with several turbine generator sets, the implementation of an additional generator in synchronous condenser operation may represent the most cost-effective solution for increasing the plant output. The power factor in the existing generators is adjusted to produce more or even exclusive active power (MW). The missing reactive power fraction (MVAr) is to be compensated by the synchronous generator which is operated as a motor at zero load. The effort associated with the installation of an additional generator in the power plant architecture can be compensated for by the following advantages: \nFind further information about our portfolio of generators for synchronous condenser applications: \nGenerators portfolio \nWith any modernization it is important to verify that all of the measures in the power plant are coordinated.

To achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP), it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating F-gases from electrical switchgear – particularly SF6, a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2. \nOur Blue portfolio uses clean air and vacuum switching technology instead. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment. \nLess global warming potential is not good enough. It has to be Zero, because 1% global warming potential is still global warming potential. It has to be Zero and it has to be now. \nNikola Jankulovski \nSiemens Energy Project Lead \nWe’ve recently invested €60 million in our Berlin facility to step up production of vacuum interrupters for our Blue portfolio. This will help to secure our supply chain – and since the plant uses 100% renewable energy, it will also increase our sustainability. \nOur Blue products use vacuum switching technology and clean air insulation to produce Zero harmful emissions - and without having to compromise on performance or economic feasibility. With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster. \nIt's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible. \nOur clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances. \nNo single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces. \nOur new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines. \nAt Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. \nThis collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly. \nOur Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action. \nWe delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy. \n\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy. \nThanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution. \n\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett. \nThis high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity. \n\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development. \nWhen we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air. \n\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid. \nThe digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance. \n\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH. \nGet in contact with our Sales Support and Customer Service \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

They support air pollution control at thermal power plants, and various industrial plants.  \nA high voltage is applied to the discharge electrode, generating a corona discharge that produces negative ions. The electrically charged dust is accumulated on the collecting electrode by an electrical field. The accumulated dust is removed by rapping hammer (dry ESP), scraping brush (dry ESP), or flushing water (wet ESP). The most important consideration in ESP for coal-fired boiler applications is to maintain and increase the collection of high-resistivity dust.  \nSiemens Energy offers suitable technologies for plant applications and operations and combines compact design and high efficiency. \nW1C single phase thyristor – HV power supply for electrostatic precipitator \nThe operating mode of the electrostatic precipitator ESP (wet/ dry) is governed by the raw gas and particulate (aerosol) conditions. As electrostatic precipitators are used in virtually all process industries, conditions specific to plant processes such as startup/ shutdown operation, load cycling as well as varying gas conditions due to changed fuels/ raw materials must be considered.   \nElectrostatic precipitator – operation, visualization, data archiving, optimization and diagnostic \nThe SIPREC ODS application is based on Windows operating system and supports Siemens Energy high voltage power supply systems for electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). SIPREC ODS (SCADA) connects simultaneously to all high voltage power supply controllers for comfortable central operation, visualization and data archiving of measured operating values. SIPREC ODS enables optimization of ESP operation and diagnostics.   \nThyristor controller upgrade – HV power supply for electrostatic precipitator \nSIPREC C is a thyristor controller upgrade set for the retrofit of existing thyristor controller of different brands.

As part of this transformation we expanded our own gas turbine test facility in the town of Finspång, Sweden, to become a model of the future energy system.  \nTogether with international partners within the research project Zero Emission Hydrogen Turbine Center (ZEHTC) we set up a demonstration plant to showcase a flexible and sustainable energy system connecting gas turbines with hydrogen, renewable energy and energy storage. This provided valuable insights to be able to accelerate into a decarbonized energy future. \nOnsite hydrogen production from renewables and excess electricity \nHydrogen enabling decarbonization of gas turbine operation \nPlatform for sharing know-how on flexible energy systems and hydrogen solutions \nEnabling extended testing toward 100 percent hydrogen capability \nWatch our video to learn more \nThe demonstrator plant provides valuable insights to be able to accelerate into a decarbonized energy future. \nRead more about the project and all the partners on our partner website \nThe test center opens up multiple possibilities: Excess energy from gas turbine tests and electricity from solar panels is used to produce hydrogen in an electrolyzer. The energy is stored as compressed hydrogen and in batteries. \nThis way a closed loop plant is created, producing its own hydrogen for our continued research and development to optimize the use of hydrogen in gas turbines. All this also while supporting our goal to be able to run our gas turbines on 100% hydrogen by 2030. \nClick on the labels to learn more about the components of the solution \nSo, what is the role of gas turbines in a sustainable energy system?  \nGas turbines have proven to be very effective in balancing intermittent renewable energy production due to their flexibility and short ramp-up times. According to the International Energy Agency, gas turbines will play an important role in providing flexibility in the electrical grid in a Sustainable Development Scenario. \nAs of today, the gas turbines we're testing in our new Zero Emission Hydrogen Turbine Center are ready to burn up to 75% of hydrogen in the fuel mix. And step by step we aim to reach 100% by 2030. \nGas turbines with hydrogen as fuel have great potential to provide more stability in future energy systems that involve increasing shares from renewable sources without increasing carbon emissions.  \nAs power from solar and wind is highly volatile and does not always match the energy demand, hydrogen – produced from these green energy sources – can be used as an energy storage solution. The subsequent combustion of hydrogen results in zero carbon emissions. \nGas turbines provide in themselves renewable power when running on hydrogen, or any other fossil-free fuel like e-fuels (i.e. e-methanol, e-diesel, e-methane) or bio-fuels (i.e. bio-methanol, ethanol, or bio-diesel). \nAs we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volat...\n \nAs we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volat... \nDownload: Hydrogen power and heat with Siemens Energy gas turbines  \n \nDownload: Hydrogen power and heat with Siemens Energy gas turbines   \nThe 'hydrogen economy' looks at changing the hydrocarbon-based infrastructure and running ...\n \nThe 'hydrogen economy' looks at changing the hydrocarbon-based infrastructure and running ... \nHow a research project is paving the way for hydrogen-based energy systems.

Fuel consumption, as the greatest single cost item, holds the biggest cost-saving potential for a ship’s operation. Moreover, the choice of a suitable propulsion system influences a whole host of other factors. For instance, quiet operation with low vibration will heighten onboard comfort. Power reserves and maneuverability will increase the vessel’s potential commercial value. And a modular, space-saving drive design will afford more flexibility when planning the layout of your ship. Our integrated drive system concepts help you find the right technology for your purposes.   \nWe offer future-proof electric propulsion/drives solutions for the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of commercial as well as naval vessels. \nOur two diesel-electric marine propulsion systems reduce fuel requirements, increase maneuverability, minimize environmental risks, and make your ship quieter and more comfortable. \nDesigned without compromising power output and fail-safe performance, our Drive MV integrated drive system offers an almost unlimited power range. \nIn the Permasyn motor for submarines, excitation is achieved with permanent magnets. This results in outstanding features in terms of uncompromising reliability and operational readiness. \nSiemens Energy developed the SGM shaft generator with motor function in response to rising fuel costs and ever-stricter environmental regulations. \nWith SISHIP BlueDrive Eco, the SISHIP BlueDrive family is now offering scalable solutions for all drive requirements, covering diverse performance graduations for small to medium-sized drives, from 5 KW in auxiliary mode up to 5.5 MW in main drives. \nWith their outstanding reliability, minimized noise signature, and stray field development, Siemens Energy DC-Prop DC drives are perfectly suitable for operation in submarines. \nDiesel-electric propulsion systems are gaining more and more importance in shipping. Shipping installations with higher fuel efficiency in all operational stages will be increasingly favored and will presumably have great potential for future growth. Drive LV is the leading technology solution. \nDiesel-electric marine propulsion systems reduce fuel requirements, increase maneuverability, minimize environmental risks, and make your ship quieter and more comfortable. However, their main advantage lies in the exceptional degree of fail-safety that Drive LV attains, thanks to its redundant system design. Indeed, Drive LV is the most reliable diesel-electric propulsion system ever built, making it a future-proof solution which helps to ensure the competitiveness of your vessels for the long term. \nProfit from a perfectly planned system consisting of diesel generators, low-voltage switchgear, frequency converter, and drive motors in combination with an ingenious propulsion control and monitoring system.  \nYour advantages with Drive LV  \nDiesel-electric propulsion systems are clearly superior both technically and in operation to normal diesel drive systems in almost all areas. Drive MV is the marine industry’s leading alternating-current propulsion system. Although it can unleash much power, it runs as quiet as a whisper with low vibration. \nDesigned without compromising power output and fail-safe performance, our Drive MV integrated drive system offers an almost unlimited power range. In addition to its high energy efficiency and low environmental impact, it is also marked by its quiet, low-vibration operation. And thanks to its state-of-the-art propulsion-control components and software, Drive MV allows vessels to be maneuvered with the highest precision. \nIts redundancy design ensures the highest possible level of reliability. Right from the design phase, its simple, compact, and modular construction using standardized components provides maximum flexibility and scope and allows for worldwide availability of spare parts and ease of maintenance. \nYour advantages with Drive MV \nSubmarines are the vessels that depend most on the complete reliability and operational readiness of their propulsion motors. A drive system that operates efficiently with very low signatures is essential for long dives and makes the boat harder to detect. The Permasyn motor for submarines is smaller and more lightweight than conventional propulsion solutions – and it achieves much better efficiency at extremely low signatures. \nIn the Permasyn motor for submarines, excitation is achieved with permanent magnets. This results in outstanding features in terms of uncompromising reliability and operational readiness, combined with high efficiency and extremely low signature values. The replacement of the electrical exciter by a permanent magnet makes possible extremely small and lightweight motors with high power density and high torque over the entire speed range. This enables the use of a larger propeller with significantly higher efficiency. \nYour advantages with Permasyn \nSpiraling fuel costs and anticipated emission controls already feature strongly in the early design stage of a ship. With the SGM shaft generator with motor function, your vessels are best equipped to meet the necessary criteria. \nSiemens Energy developed the SGM shaft generator with motor function in response to rising fuel costs and ever-stricter environmental regulations. It incorporates motor- and generator-driven operation in the vessel’s main drive system, and can be used for electrical power generation as well as for boosting the main drive system. At the same time, it significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions. The SGM shaft generator is available with either low- or medium-voltage technology and can be combined with waste-heat recovery or hybrid solutions to increase drive performance. \nYour advantages with SGM \nSiemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens. \nWith the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system. \nYour advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC \nThe synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent. \nThe SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel.

They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do. \nAs one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours.  \nDuring the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat.  \nLearn more about transforming heat production \nA new high-temperature industrial heat pump for the cooling center at Potsdamer Platz \nThe new river heat pump from MVV supplies climate-friendly heat from Rhine water to around 3,500 households - One of the largest heat pumps of its kind in Europe. \nFind out more about the MVV Mannheim, Germany \nHeat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. \nSiemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids. The refrigerants have negligible environmental impact in all aspects: \nAs responsible manufacturers, we see refrigerants as a design element of a heat pumps system. We will use the optimum refrigerant for the specific solution. \nDecarbonizing heat: The hot topic we can't ignore \nHeat accounts for around half of global energy consumption, contributing 40% of CO2 emissions. On the way to carbon neutrality, we thus can no longer ignore the topic. In an excellent article Christian Hüttl and Norbert Wenn outline the tools to green heat - at home, in buildings and in industry. \nMaking the most of waste heat \nBefore the end of 2022, at Potsdamer Platz in the German capital Berlin, a novel hightemperature industrial heat pump will start supplying the city’s district heating system with net-zero heat.

To achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP), it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating F-gases from electrical switchgear – particularly SF6, a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2. \nOur Blue portfolio uses clean air and vacuum switching technology instead. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment. \nLess global warming potential is not good enough. It has to be Zero, because 1% global warming potential is still global warming potential. It has to be Zero and it has to be now. \nNikola Jankulovski \nSiemens Energy Project Lead \nWe’ve recently invested €60 million in our Berlin facility to step up production of vacuum interrupters for our Blue portfolio. This will help to secure our supply chain – and since the plant uses 100% renewable energy, it will also increase our sustainability. \nOur Blue products use vacuum switching technology and clean air insulation to produce Zero harmful emissions - and without having to compromise on performance or economic feasibility. With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster. \nIt's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible. \nOur clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances. \nNo single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces. \nOur new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines. \nAt Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. \nThis collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly. \nOur Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action. \nWe delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy. \n\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy. \nThanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution. \n\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett. \nThis high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity. \n\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development. \nWhen we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air. \n\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid. \nThe digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance. \n\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH. \nGet in contact with our Sales Support and Customer Service \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

We support projects from conceptual design through commercial operation and beyond. Our CAES solution includes all the associated above ground systems, plant engineering, procurement, construction, installation, start-up services and long term service support. \nAs renewable power generation from wind and solar grows in its contribution to the world’s energy mix, utilities will need to balance the generation variability of these sustainable resources with demandfluctuations. Power-generation operators can use compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology for a reliable, cost-effective, and long-duration energy storage solution at grid scale.  \nSiemens Energy CAES improves utilization of renewable energy resources by absorbing GW-hours of energy that would otherwise be curtailed and provides grid balancing and reserve services with lower fuel usage and carbon footprint than other controllable resources.  \nDiabatic storage units dissipate part of the compression heat into the atmosphere with intercoolers. The air must be reheated to be returned to the CAES cycle. Energy and ancillary services with low fuel consumption provide best efficiency. \nThe adiabetic CAES cycle stores energy in form of pressure in a cavern, while compression heat is stored in a thermal storage.

Based on more than 40 years of experience in medium-voltage range and more than 6 million delivered vacuum interrupters, Siemens Energy has introduced this proven technology to high-voltage power networks in 2010. This game-changing technology offers several advantages: \nOur complete 3AP family up to 1100 kV relies on our arc-quenching principles, either the self-compression or the dynamic self-compression principle using the thermal energy of the arc. Siemens patented this method of arc quenching in 1973 and has continued to develop the technology of the self-compression interrupter unit ever since. \nThe drive concept of the 3AP circuit breaker family is based on the patented stored-energy spring principle. The mechanism types differ in terms of the number, size and arrangement of the opening and closing springs. Both the opening and closing springs are located inside the operating mechanism, thereby achieving a simple and sturdy device. \nAll Siemens Energy high-voltage circuit breakers are designed in a well proven modular platform concept. This leads to a wide variety of breaker types and strong flexibility with regard to various applications according to our customers’ requirements as well as high availability at eminently competitive price.   \nThe main components, such as the operating mechanism, control system, base frame, kinematic chain and insulator designs are identical and based on decades of manufacturing and operating experience – and are also used in our GIS switchgear range. \nYou can find informational materials on our circuit breakers and details about our services here. \nWe can gladly help you with installation, commissioning, diagnostics and malfunctions \nService for switching products & systems \nCustomer support center \nRegister for upcoming events & webinars \nSiemens Energy fairs, events & webinars \nSiemens Energy Downloads \nWhitepapers & Recordings \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources.

Among other things, this means our proven Omnivise T3000 control system security protection will be enhanced with Tenable OT Security at the core. \nSiemens Energy and National Academic and Non-profit Partners announced a new Cybersecurity & Industrial Infrastructure Security Apprenticeship Program (CIISAp). \nBlog: Building the Next Generation of Industrial Cyber Defenders \nEos.ii™ is the first AI-based monitoring and detection platform that can serve as the foundation for securing industrial IoT in an era of persistent cyberattacks \nHere's why: \nEnergy companies increasingly recognize that their likelihood of being attacked is nearly 100% and that they must strengthen their agility and resiliency so they can respond when - not if - they are attacked. \nGovernments are responding to the growing cyber threat by rolling out comprehensive critical infrastructure regulations. But there is a difference between being compliant and being secure. \nIncreased connectivity, automation, and data-driven operations makes a strong cybersecurity program essential. \nSiemens Energy, Saudi Aramco and the World Economic Forum launched a cybersecurity playbook for the oil and gas industry. The report, “Cyber Resilience in the Oil and Gas Industry Playbook”, establishes a blueprint for boards and business leaders to evaluate cyber risk and enhance cyber resilience across the industry. \nEos.ii™ empowers CISOs and SOCs with the platform and insights needed to scale up security to meet the demands of IoT business models. It offers unmatched capabilities to help energy and critical infrastructure organizations build and maintain robust, adaptable, and resilient defenses in a fast-moving and competitive IoT future. \nManaged Detection and Response (MDR) powered by Eos.ii™ is an AI-based service, powered by Siemens Energy’s revolutionary monitoring platform. It provides energy companies with the visibility and context to shine a light into industrial operating environment to stop attacks before they occur. \nThis white paper offers an example of an attack against a fictional electric utility, as it manages an unfolding crisis and illustrates how incident response planning can make a difference in reaching the least disruptive outcome. \nWind farm developers, owners, and operators share an interest in cybersecurity risk manage ment strategies that account for the full life cycle of these assets. To ensure secure reliable renewable power delivery, offshore wind farms should be built and operated with a secure by design approach, with systems-level integration in mind, and with the understanding that the threat environment will continue to evolve long after construction is complete.  \nThis MIT Technology Review report gathers insights from leading practitioners in the oil and gas sector to better understand how global companies are applying advanced digital technologies to both improve efficiency and protect themselves from cyberattacks — and why AI is the key to unlocking and securing the energy transition. \nThis report from the Ponemon Institute highlights the unique cybersecurity requirements for  for the Utility industry. \nIn conjunction with the Ponemon Institute, this report delves into the cyber readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East. \nLearn how US companies in the oil and gas industry are addressing cybersecurity risks in the operational technology (OT) environment. \nOur offering:\nGap analysis \nWhat you will get:\nFindings report that includes both a critical gap summary and a roadmap for recommended remediation \nOur offering:\nIncident response planning and testing \nWhat you will get:\nDetailed plan on how to respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including emergency procedures, roles, and resources \nOur offering:\nFirewall assessment and patch management \nWhat you will get:\nFindings and recommendations for heightened security; malware pattern updates and management \nOur offering:\nSecurity event monitoring system \nWhat you will get:\nReal-time monitoring by collecting and parsing security logs \nOur broad portfolio combines leading industry technologies and tools with expert know-how \nSiemens Energy, along with its technology partner Darktrace, brings real-time anomaly detection to the industrial OT environment. Siemens Energy Plant Security Monitoring service provides the continuous visibility required to make smarter, faster decisions. \nThe Siemens Energy Vulnerability Management solution provides a non-intrusive way to discover, visualize, and monitor sensitive systems continuously. We provide technical support for designing, deploying, and enabling Tenable's unique software on the control system network to provide a complete picture across the network. \nPlant managers often lack an up-to-date, comprehensive asset inventory of all connected assets. Siemens Energy, in conjunction with PAS™, helps our customers meet this challenge with automated Cyber Asset Management. This includes configuration change management and advice on potential cybersecurity threats. \nMany energy companies keep their networks unconnected because they believe this makes them cyber secure. This misguided strategy will fall victim to more successful attacks, from inside and outside. Connectivity gives you visibility which provides insight. \nMany companies do not know what assets and devices exist on their OT networks. \nThis limits their understanding of where their infrastructure is most vulnerable. \nMost energy companies have focused on building up their IT cyber capabilities. But these cannot be simply deployed into the OT environment because of differences in the systems, data, devices, and critical dependencies. Because of this inattention to OT, cybersecurity experts who can secure complex, aging, and interdependent infra-structure are hard to find. \nOT systems are older than IT systems. OT equipment, which can last decades, is often developed with proprietary systems that have exposures and vulnerabilities difficult to protect. \nEven if a company detects a potential intrusion into its OT cybersecurity environment, it may lack the plans or capabilities to respond effectively. \nCyber solutions must apply across multiple vendors to provide a single, seamless cyber program. \nIf you say “yes” to one or more of the questions above, you are not alone. For energy companies, the probability of a cyber attack is nearly 100%.   \nOvercoming the fear of connectivity is essential because the benefits of digitalization are too great. Organizations must focus on agility and resiliency so they can respond when – not if – they are attacked. \nWe combine our deep OT know-how with cutting-edge technology from selected partners to provide end-to-end solutions for every step in our customers' cybersecurity journey. \nThe page with name \"Cybersecurity for Energy\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service-offerings/digital-services/cybersecurity.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Gas-insulated switchgear\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/gas-insulated-switchgear.html\" has the following content:\nWith the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct.  \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and zero toxicity is by using clean air. Gas-insulated switchgear combine vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nEnabling higher voltage levels ​for wind turbines​. It is essential to live energy transition and increase resource efficiency. ​Wind power generation is making a major contribution for the  growing power demand and a new generation of wind power plants require innovative technologies. ​Our compact, environmentally friendly, high-voltage gas-insulated 8VM1 Blue GIS for on- & offshore installations up to 72.5 kV is an optimal contribution to enlarged wind turbine power and reduced cable losses. \nThe 8VN1 Blue GIS maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2. \nAlso in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV.  \nLPITs are innovative voltage and current transformers providing a safe, reliable and standardized solution for measurement and protection applications in GIS. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan.\nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan. \nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nThe 8VM1 Blue GIS® is now certified to withstand real earthquake conditions. The qualification level was tested “high”, which ensures structural integrity and continuous functionality during highest loads. \nResilience for high-voltage equipment: An 8VN1 Blue GIS typical bay for the 145 kV level successfully passed seismic qualification shake-table tests in line with IEEE 693 high level specifications. Neither the specimen nor the support structure sustained any structural damage or suffered from impaired functionality as a result of the tests. \nCerius is the first utility in Denmark to order a Clean Air insulated switchgear with vacuum switching technology. \nNetze BW, Burladingen, Germany \nSiemens Energy has delivered more than 4000 units of sustainable transformers and gasinsulated switchgear for the installation in the nacelles and towers of offshore wind parks. This is an important contribution to the expansion of renewable energy sources, which is in line with the outcome of the latest world energy forum report. Besides, it supports the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  \nSiemens Energy has been awarded the contract to deliver ten bays of Blue gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) to Fingrid, Finland’s transmission system operator. It will be the first GIS in Finland that replaces F-gases with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with zero potential for global warming.

The company’s additive manufacturing capabilities comprise mechanized cladding, micro laser welding, cold spray silver coating and laser metal deposition. \nThe inauguration of the prototype of a serial production line at the gas turbine factory in Berlin marks an important milestone for the IDEA project. It is part of the initiative “Line integration of additive manufacturing processes”, funded by German Ministry of Education and Research. \nSiemens Energy is driving the industrialization and commercialization of AM processes. Here are some examples of 3D printed parts working in the real world. \nSelective laser melting (SLM), also known as direct metal laser melting (DMLM) or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is a rapid prototyping, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM) technique designed to use a high power-density laser to melt and fuse metallic powders together. SLM is often considered a subcategory of selective laser sintering (SLS). The SLM process has the ability to fully melt the metal material into a solid three-dimensional part unlike SLS. \nLaser cladding is a form of surface coating that incorporates the use of lasers and a feeding mechanism to coat the substrate with a layer of desired metal or ceramic material. The laser melts the metal and coats the moving substrate with a fine layer. The feed metal is fully melted while the laser also transfers some of its energy to the substrate. This allows for the creation of a strong metallurgical bond between the substrate and the coating. \nWire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a large-scale metal AM technology that uses an arc welding process to produce metal parts additively. \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy.\n \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy. \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems.\n \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems. \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions.\n \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions. \nPlease fill out the form below and receive your download link! \nThe page with name \"Additive Manufacturing\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/additive-manufacturing.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"LIFE OCEAN\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/life-ocean.html\" has the following content:\nThe LIFE OCEAN project is the first project which aims to use a carbon-neutral fuel for electric energy production on a Sanlorenzo superyacht \nThe maritime sector represents about 13.5% the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at EU level (Source: EEA, 2021). In order to foster decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector, the IMO fixed a target of 80% cut of GHG emissions until 2050 and cut of 100% until 2100. The path towards decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector will also lead to the reduction and/or abatement of pollutants like CO, NOX, SOX, PM, BC, HC that are emitted by fossil fuels combustion. The installation of a methanol reformer coupled to a HTPEM fuel cell could represent an interesting solution as auxiliary power unit of yachts and superyachts, to cover the hotel load but also to sustain slow speed cruising and maneuvering operations in ports. \nAim of the LIFE OCEAN (onboard clean energy and no-noise) project is to substitute the traditional diesel generators used to cover the hotel loads of a Sanlorenzo superyacht with a methanol-based fuel cell system. Along with air pollution mitigation, on board noise will be abated while underwater noise will be reduced thanks to the elimination of diesel generators. The solution adopted constitutes a zero-carbon technology for the maritime sector, adopting green methanol whose large capacity production is growing at both EU and extra-EU level. \nInstead of methanol the project will foster the adoption of green methanol (methanol produced by renewable sources, i.e. from agricultural and forestry residues, biogas, organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, synthesis of H2 produced from electrolytic processes and CO2 coming from carbon capture technologies). \nFurthermore, methanol is easy to store and handle, it is biodegradable and does not contain sulphur. It is liquid at environmental temperature and pressure, it presents a good energy density (around 22 MJ/kg) and does not need cryogenic tanks for its storage like LNG.  \n1. Step\nFirst, the sustainable produced methanol needs to be mixed with water to enable the electrochemical reaction in the reformer. To safe space, weight and hence energy on the vessel it is our goal to find a solution to reuse the water produced in the fuel cell instead of installing a water tank. Resulting in an onboard water cycle and savings of this valuable resource.\n \n1.

Companies need to demonstrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or verify the volume of CO2 emissions in their products. In addition, there is a growing demand to prove the sustainability of green products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthetic fuels, green steel, and other commodities. \nWith CertaLink Energy Certification, we can track the environmental impact of sustainable production processes along the entire product cycle. \nCertaLink Energy Certification is already proving the green origin of the e-fuels applications in the Porsche motorsport fleet at Haru Oni. Step by step, Haru Oni is transforming the fuel industry, supported by the certification process to validate the green origins of e-fuels.  \nDeveloped with innovation partners TÜV SÜD and the German Energy Agency (dena), CertaLink Energy Certification uses blockchain technology to connect physical assets to digital decentralized infrastructure. It tracks the low and zero carbon energy from source to consumption along the value chain, validating the energy's origin plus providing detailed insights and attributes. As a result of automated and tamper-proof recording and tracking of energy-specific data, a CertaLink certificate is valid around the world through the entire low or zero carbon value chain.   \nAre you already a registered customer? If yes, you can access your personal dashboard here. \nIf you need assistance, please find your service contact here. \nIf you are not registered yet, please get in touch. \nSustainability certificates such as CertaLink Energy Certificates enable \"Sustainability Claims\" in an automated, tamper-proof, and government-approved manner. Sustainably certified products have a higher market value and offer benefits like customs and tax relief for imports and exports These green energy certifications are required by all companies that wish to market their products as sustainable. With a CertaLink certificate, you can trace the zero or low carbon origin of your products throughout the entire value chain. \nWhether you are planning your facility, or you have already established a production facility, you can connect to the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. We will connect the certification manager with your Instrumentation and Control system or smart meters to access your measurement data and generate green energy certificates for your products. Plant shutdowns are usually not necessary. \nThe CertaLink certification process is comparable to classic ISO certifications, but the products are continuously certified per production unit. To receive the corresponding automated issued certificate, companies must adhere to a conventional certification approach.  \nWe will advise you to choose the optimal certification scheme for your business purposes and prepare the certification together with you. There are document checklists depending on the selected certification scheme. A detailed list of required documents will be provided to you so that you can prepare your sustainability certification in a structured manner.   \nIn order to apply an internationally accepted renewable energy certification standard, we are partnering with independent certification bodies, e.g. TÜV SÜD and dena, the German Energy Agency. \nIt is important to distinguish between three types of fees. An onboarding fee is charged during the connection and commissioning of the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. A yearly membership fee is charged after completed onboarding. Later on, each certificate creation will incur a fee. \nThe CertaLink Energy Certification Manager is based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Unlike public chains, where transactions are publicly available to everyone, in CertaLink the data is processed on a private permissioned blockchain. It means that only independent trusted and explicitly contracted node operators are participating in the network with limited access to structured data. All site data is transferred in encoded format and converted into declarations by DLT smart contracts. These declarations can be shared based on commercial operator settings. \n“TÜV SÜD has a clear focus on sustainability and decarbonization.

The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field. \nDubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world. \nSince the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats. \nThe basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency. \nWith our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling. \nParabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam. \nThe parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants. \nA circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine. \nThe advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field. This means that higher working fluid temperatures in the receiver (up to 1000°C) and better steam parameters are feasible, even supercritical steam is expected. \nThe number of concentrated solar power plants has increased tremendously in the past ten years. Today we see many different regimes of operations, each of which poses a different challenge to power generation equipment. The design of each steam turbine is adapted to these challenges. \nExamples for the regimes of operation for a solarthermal power plant, with a power output of 50 MW: \nAs market leader in industrial steam turbines, we command a comprehensive product portfolio for solar thermal plants, covering the full range from 1.5 MW to more than 250 MW. \nOptimized for challenging cycle \nCSP plants require steam turbines which are optimized for their complex and challenging cycle conditions. Bearing in mind that efficiency and total cost of ownership are key to any investment decision, we incorporate operational experience into extensive R&D and engineering activities to adapt the turbines to the specific requirements of the CSP technology. \nExcellent daily start-up solutions \nDay and night cycle often requires a large number of starts and fast daily startup capabilities from CSP steam turbines. When focusing on annual power production, the short start-up times of the turbines are of great benefit to the CSP plant owner. Daily cycling and temperature variations require special attention. \nReheat improves efficiency \nReheat solutions improve efficiency and reduce problems with erosion/corrosion and moisture in the LP turbine. Our steam turbines meet all customer requirements for economic installation and operation and provide excellent flexibility for all cycling conditions. The turbines are suitable for higher steam parameters and can be operated in non-reheat, single reheat and double reheat cycles. \nReliable steam turbine technology \nOur steam turbines are tailored to the customer requirements and shipped assembled for easy installation at site. This reduces time and manpower in the installation phase. All steam turbines are available with axial or radial exhaust and suitable for air- and water-cooled plants. \nWe provide optimal instrumentation and controls (I&C) design for CSP & Hybrid-PV plants for achieving the full dispatchability of solar energy power plants.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.\n \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe.\n \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nAt Hesseln substation, Germany, Siemens Energy and grid operator Westnetz are showing how innovation can drive decarbonization and digitalization in energy transmission. \nImplementation of the innovative vacuum switching technology in combination with a digitally enhanced circuit-breaker for transmission grid operator (TSO) ENEA. \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues. \nBy Frank Jossi \nNetze BW, Noerdlingen, Germany \nWhile we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nOur high-voltage circuit breakers, regardless of type or voltage range, are designed in a well proven modular platform concept.

There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably. \nBasically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment. \nHVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime. \nThanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably. \nGrid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects. \nRefurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system.  \nThree basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies. \nHigh-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio: \nReasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components. \nSiemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan.  \nNo refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project. \nSiemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support. \nFinding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system. \nWhile regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance.  \nSiemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects. \nThe Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security.

Reaching them won’t come about by itself. Apart from intelligent energy management and improved energy efficiency, we need to decarbonize power generation for utilities and industry. And since we can’t rebuild energy generation from scratch, assets viewed as burdensome today, such as coal power plants, must be repurposed as bridges to a new energy future. It’s called Brownfield Transformation: Converting existing power plants, so they help us reach the decarbonized economy we all aim for.  \nBrownfield Transformation: Building a bridge to a new energy future \nInnovative solutions for gas-fired power plants \nAs the world enters a new energy age, you’re looking for affordable solutions to reduce emissions while ensuring a reliable and safe power supply. But your fossil power plants hardly fit into a decarbonized future. So, you're faced with the decision to build either a new plant on a greenfield – or convert a brownfield power plant into a new productive asset.  \nBrownfield transformation is a holistic approach to decarbonizing legacy coal, oil and gas-fired power plants combined with the use of existing assets and infrastructure. For example, repowering steam power plants with new gas turbines. It also lays the foundation for a mid-term solution: turning existing brownfield power plants into decarbonized hybrid power plants, which could include power generation from renewable energy sources, various storage technologies, and grid stability services. All of this lays the groundwork for future net zero energy systems. Such systems could facilitate sector coupling by integrating renewables, industry, or mobility sectors with the help of green hydrogen.  \nIf your decarbonization needs turn out to be rather complex, we advise undertaking a detailed Energy System Design, which comprises a data-based integrated technology & business case study that examines future revenue streams and site surroundings using the available decarbonization portfolio. If technology preselection, e.g., fuel switch, energy storage, heat pumps, etc. is an important factor for you, we can develop your project directly. Whatever your approach, in the end your solution will be a combination of technology components tailored to your business case, market demands as well as efficiency and decarbonization goals. \nNo matter which solution you choose for your brownfield power plant conversion, there are numerous potential benefits: avoiding stranded assets; less investment compared to greenfield projects; shorter implementation time, including fewer permits to apply for. At the same time, you may even open new revenue streams. Apart from these advantages, brownfield conversion could also help further your reputation while you contribute to the common good. Altogether, not only will you support decarbonization efforts, but continuing to employ qualified personnel can also significantly ease socioeconomic strains on local communities. \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir...\n \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir... \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe...\n \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe... \nWe are on the way to a carbon-free future, but we won't get there overnight.

Electricity and heating are major cost factors for industrial plants. That means there’s a long-term cost benefit in having your own power plant at your factory, mining, or production facility. It also helps you achieve climate goals and stay ahead of the competition. We will create just the right power plant solution for your purposes. \nGlobal megatrends and the energy transformation redefine the requirements for competitiveness in all energy-intensive industries. Reliable, economical and environmentally compatible supplies of power, steam, heating and cooling play an increasingly important role. Get ready for the future with us: Concentrate on your core business, while we help you manage your energy supply. \nEvery industry, every factory, and every facility has its own unique demands for power supply. That’s why we configure and optimize your system individually, from the initial design to the final component. It goes without saying that we incorporate technologies proven in hundreds of facilities and over thousands of operating hours. Another factor that cuts your project risk: We pre-manufacture entire modules and test them away from the construction site. This means much less expense incurred on-site at your facility. \nSiemens Energy has a thorough understanding of the processes in your industry. After all, we’ve been building, expanding, and modernizing all kinds of industrial facilities for decades. We know that production processes have to be closely interlinked with ancillary activities like electricity and heat generation and energy distribution. Only once everything is integrated can the opportunities for automation and digitalization be exploited to the full. \nProcessing mineral raw materials requires a vast amount of energy. That’s why procuring electricity and heat makes up a significant proportion of operating costs. Entities that supply their own electricity and heat using their own power plant will enjoy significant cost savings. And with a sturdy, state-of-the-art combined cycle power plant, they can also substantially improve their environmental life cycle assessment. \nFrom production to transportation and refining – the oil and gas business is getting tougher. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations are forcing many players to take action. Companies that invest in state-of-the-art on-site power generation enjoy multiple benefits – by curbing their emissions through the flexible use of available raw materials and also by using technologies that seamlessly integrate into their production systems. We provide you robust mechanical engineering that will operate reliably – even with frequent changes of load and fluctuating gas quality. \nWhether you process recycled fiber or use cellulose and lignin from the raw material wood, your systems will consume large volumes of electricity and heat. Generate your own process steam with an integrated power plant on-site. We offer plants with combined heat and power (CHP) in all scales to meet every need. That means you can remain flexible and independent over the long run. \nMining is all about raw materials. When it comes to competition, it is production costs that matter – and energy costs are a key factor. The remote regions where raw materials are extracted are often not connected to public power networks. An on-site supply requires flexible facilities that can deliver power under tough conditions at low cost. Whether it’s for open-cast or underground mining, in cold or hot environments, as a standalone system or a back-up for renewable sources – we will design and build exactly the power plant solution you need to bolster your competitive position. \nSafety is paramount in chemical processes, and outages are both risky and costly – so your electricity supply must be totally reliable. This works best if you have your own generating system on-site, which will make you independent of external suppliers and curb costs in the long term. If a power plant also permits heat extraction, all the better – that will make your entire system even more efficient. We build the right solution for you – and integrate it seamlessly into your chain of processes. \nThe energy landscape is changing. Small gas-fired power plants will be a mainstay of our energy supply system for the foreseeable future. That’s because they can serve as a flexible back-up for renewables, they’re highly efficient and operate reliably, and they can enable regions to function independently. On islands or at remote industrial sites, covering basic load or peak, with or without heat extraction – our industrial power plant solution will perfectly suit your specific requirements. \nThe SGT-800 is the flagship of the Siemens portfolio of industrial gas turbines and provides excellent performance in combined cycle operation. It has proven itself in grid support and as a reliable backup for renewable energy sources. It is equally well-suited for independently supplying an industrial facility, with or without a grid connection. You can build on a fleet availability of over 97 percent. \nGet even more out of the energy in your fuel: A steam generator will use waste heat from the gas turbine to generate steam, which can drive a steam turbine. Combined cycle operation pays off. \nNew gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability.  \nMore than 1,500 power stations are in use around the world. Here are some of our top projects we have implemented with our customers. \nDo you want to supply your facility with power, reliably and cost-effectively? Or free yourself from reliance on a costly public supply? Do you need a flexible reserve power plant? Together we’ll find the perfect solution for your particular challenge. \nContact \nThe page with name \"Industrial power plants\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/industrial-power-plants.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Surge arresters\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/surge-arresters.html\" has the following content:\nContinuous research and development, the wealth of Siemens Energy know-how and comprehensive worldwide experience give Siemens Energy surge arresters a leading edge in overvoltage protection.

Our 40-year track record in serving the subsea oil and gas industry is a solid foundation for also supporting the offshore and subsea renewables industry in the coming energy transition. \nDecarbonization, digitalization, and electrification are three major trends in the oil and gas industry. These trends will influence the way forward with regard to infrastructure, products and processes across the oil and gas market. In addition, we are seeing the emergence of offshore and subsea renewable power generation and energy production and storage.  \nEnabling large-scale subsea processing by powering the subsea fields of the future – down to 3,000 meters. \nThe subsea power grid components are “born digital” and equipped with sensors and high-quality data acquisition to enable full operational digital twins of the subsea power units. The data is stored in the cloud and on premise and data analytics is applied to the data to produce a hierarchy of health Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) for the subsea assets. This gives a very high level of transparency into the equipment and enables cost efficient operation and maintenance of the subsea power system.   \nOur subsea products and systems portfolio covers a broad spectrum of applications. Going far beyond power and distribution, it comprises everything from pioneering technologies for subsea control and surveillance to exemplary service and support based on extensive marinization expertise. As a result, we are able to provide answers over the entire life of the field. \nPower generation represents most Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in the offshore oil & gas sector. On the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), offshore platforms produce around 18 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. It is estimated that around 75% of this is associated with electricity generation, primarily from gas turbine generators (GTGs). \nTen years ago, a future where subsea fields and their power-hungry process equipment could be fully electrified, enabling long step-outs to tap remote reserves with lean new infrastructure architectures, lit the fuse for a spate of investment in subsea power distribution. \nThe page with name \"Subsea solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/subsea-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Digital\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/oil-gas/digital.html\" has the following content:\nThe ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) is driving the rapid pace of digital adoption across multiple industries. The oil and gas industry is beginning a transformation of its own, increasingly looking toward data-driven solutions to boost performance, enhance efficiency and ultimately, to reduce costs. Siemens Energy helps customers optimize the performance of critical oil and gas assets and equipment. We draw on an extensive software portfolio, deep expertise in data analytics and extensive experience in oil and gas and other industries.   \nDigitalization and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand when it comes to protecting assets against cyberattacks.  \nDigital technologies are helping almost every industry rewrite its operating landscape, and the oil and gas industry is catching up. Advancements in technology, the falling cost of digitalization, and the connectivity of smart devices provide a real competition-beating opportunity for oil and gas companies who play the digital revolution right. The potential benefits of going digital are increased productivity, shorter response and intervention times, cost savings, safer operations, and asset integrity as well as sustainable resource treatment. By utilizing our highly engineered Artificial Lift technologies like AI4ESP or SIWELL, we are able to efficiently optimize automation for well pumps. \nThink offshore production can be profitable in a cyclical oil and gas market? Aker BP does. And so does Siemens Energy.  \nIn fact, Aker BP's bold publically stated objective is to drive production costs to US$7 per barrel. On the Ivar Aasen Field Development project Siemens worked closely with Aker BP to implement condition monitoring—a data-driven approach to optimizing equipment maintenance schedules, and ultimately, to reducing costs. \n \nInstead of monitoring critical equipment from a North Sea platform, Aker BP personnel monitor it from an onshore control room in Trondheim, Norway, 1,000 km away. A unique process known as time-stamping, as opposed to the more conventional sampling, enhances the accuracy of the acquired machine data, better positioning crews to predict and preempt any maintenance issues. \nThe net result? Fewer personnel working on the remote offshore platform for extended periods, not to mention traveling to and from the jobsite via helicopter, and a significant OPEX savings. \nData-driven remote condition monitoring optimizes offshore maintenance, reduces costs  \nAs the world’s oil and gas industry strives to expand margins by reducing production costs wherever possible, advanced capabilities enabled by the integration and digitalization of upstream operations can help in substantial ways. One prime example is remote condition monitoring of well-site equipment, especially offshore. \nAker BP deployed remote condition monitoring on its offshore platform, built to develop Ivar Aasen field in the Norwegian North Sea, in an effort to reduce OPEX costs, increase regularity and improve operations safety. \nThis technical paper presents Siemens Energy's view on key cybersecurity defensive mechanisms based on the pipeline control and communications systems defense-in-depth approach, focusing on Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) protection measures, sequence of event (SOE) clock synchronization, multi-factor authentication, early-warning cyber intrusion detection and ransomware recovery.

The HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. \nThe gas turbine is capable of world-class fast cold starts and hot re-starts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages and free thermal expansion of rotor and casing parts during transients. Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), an active clearance control,  ensures robustness and low turbine degradation at start-up. GT ramp-up rate 85 MW/min. \nThe advanced can-annular combustion system with dual fuel capability allows for higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility. 25 premix burners improve the fuel/oxygen mixing. The ACE combustion system allows for GT turn-down to 30% minimum environmental load. \nAll turbine blades and vanes are equipped with an innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating. This leads to higher combined cycle efficiency due to less cooling air consumption and reduced operational costs due to higher blade robustness. \nThe HL-class has been designed to minimize outage times. Rotor de-stacking can easily be done on site thanks to the Hirth-serrated disc assembly. All rotating compressor and turbine blades can be replaced without rotor lift or rotor de-stacking. Turbine blade 1 and turbine blade 4 are removable without cover lift. With 33kEBH service intervals the service concept is very competitive. \nDue to proven and validated package and plant concepts the HL-class can easily be integrated in our power plants for simple cycle or combined cycle operation. This enables fast project execution. More than 50,0000  hours are saved on site due to modularized design and pre-engineered solutions. \nThe new HL-class is based on the reliable engine architecture of the SGT-8000H series with design features that have proved reliability in operation for years:  \nBased on proven design and relying on the vast fleet experience of the SGT-8000H series, the new SGT5-9000HL combines the best of past experience with newly developed technologies. Thus, efficiency and performance are pushed to the next level. \nThe HL-class consists of two engines: The SGT5-9000HL for 50 Hz, and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz. A modular design approach allows for a substantial number of common parts. The  HL-class is designed for high operational flexibility and has a joint DNA with the proven Siemens Energy H-class: Air-cooled 4-stage turbine, steel rotor / hirth serration / single tie bolt design, Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO), can-annular combustion system \nCommon parts minimize manufacturing risks and shorten lead times \nWorld-class fast cold starts and hot-restarts due to the light and stiff rotor with internal cooling air passages \nTo achieve top performance and efficiency levels, the HL-class turbines are operating at highest combustion temperatures with an advanced combustion system.An innovative multi-layer thermal barrier coating and super-efficient internal cooling features are protecting turbine blades and vanes while reducing the need of cooling air.Additionally, advanced 3D blading leads to higher aero efficiency in the compressor.  A free-standing, internally cooled turbine blade 4 reduces exhaust losses and allows for higher exhaust temperatures to enhance the water-steam cycle. \nfor higher aero efficiency \nfor higher firing temperatures and more operational flexibility \nfor better blade robustness and less cooling air consumption \nfor higher power output \nSiemens Energy has re-invented the methodology for plant construction with a modular Power Core™.The Power Core™ consists of prefabricated Siemens Energy Solution Blocks and prefabricated pipe racks. These plug-and-play blocks are fabricated and tested in a controlled manufacturing environment and delivered to site as large modules which can be lifted into place for assembly. This results in increased safety on site, accelerated schedules, less dependence on the availability of skilled local labor and in the end lower project risk. HL-class power plants are based on one or more HL-class gas turbines and can achieve more than 64% efficiency in combind cycle operation: \nSCC5-9000HL 1x1: 880 MW SCC5-9000HL 2x1: 1,760 MW \n All components are designed with high focus on optimized LCOE, highest availability and serviceability. Several service features are supporting this.  \nTremendous service fleet experience and continuous development result in a competitive service concept with 33,000 Equivalent Base Hours (EBH) / 1,250 Equivalent Starts (ES). \nfor reduced down times \nthrough easy burner replacement thanks to innovative robot technology (picture: exemplary application – SGT5-8000H burner replacement) \nThe SGT6-9000HL runs on natural gas, LNG, distillate oil, or other fuels. The engine is equipped with DLE burners and has the capability to burn up to 50 vol% of hydrogen (H₂). \nWhile reaching highest levels of performance and efficiency, the HL-class is still complying with NOx and CO regulations.

In addition to the traditional need to reliably, safely, and economically distribute electricity from the generator or incoming grid down to the consumers, there are new emerging challenges, including the need to implement governmental directives to save power, and to utilize the growing amount of renewable energy that's being fed into the grid, which is making grid control increasingly complex. The latter can result in voltage fluctuations and even cause plant downtime. Industrial Grid and Energy Management allows you to safely and reliably engineer, plan, and realize your factory power distribution system while providing you with the tools to meet today's new demands and challenges. \nIndustrial power distribution is a fully integrated power distribution and management system for planning and monitoring the power supply for the complete process chain in your paper factory. This also includes a power supply for black starts and emergency power operation. In conjunction with intelligent control and switching devices and our integrated communications network, indsutrial power distribution offers the right technical solutions for all of your requirements: high availability, adequate supply capacity, expandability and scalability, consistently high power quality, and environmental compatibility. It goes without saying that it's also economical, saves resources, and is easy to operate. \nIndustrial power distribution includes all the necessary components to build a complex power distribution system for your mill, including power and distribution transformers, HV, MV, and LV switchgear in AIS or GIS versions, and appropriate protection systems. \nThanks to sophisticated power control technology, Industrial Power Distribution always gives you an overview of all processes in your electrical installations and provides you with essential service information. The system monitors and records all switching processes throughout your entire factory using smart devices like IMOCODE, SIPROTEC control, and fiber-optic networks for field-bus communication. This allows you to predict load requirements and inform the operator or take action to prevent the mill's power demand from rising to unacceptably high load peaks that result in extra charges. \nIndustrial Power Distribution stands for power supply solutions from a single source – fully integrated and coordinated, across all voltage levels, and over the entire lifecycle. The network design starts with the collection of all relevant mill data, including consumer power requirements, starting characteristics of large drives, short-circuit capacity of all components, and grid parameters. Other criteria need to be considered in the engineering,for example, emergency and back-up concepts, mill availability and grid requirements. Finally to verify the mill's design and optimize the recovery time after a mill network or grid supply fault, dynamic network simulations based on fault scenarios are created to guarantee maximum reliability. \nPower Intelligence is a comprehensive portfolio of digital products and solutions from Siemens Energy. These are designed to enable power utilities and industries to unlock the full potential of their electrical infrastructure. They provide insightful data for decision-making, enhance asset management, improve reliability and efficiency, and reduce operational costs. \nThe pulp and paper industry has already taken a leading role in the closed-cycle economy by making optimal use of resources, integrating waste products into processes, optimizing energy requirements, transforming into a self-sufficient energy cycle, and using digitalization tools. \nWe know the importance of a flexible steam turbine design and customization. That is why we provide steam turbines with various uncontrolled and controlled extraction options adapted to the steam flow in your process. We can offer the precise number of extractions indicated by your process requirements. \nThe Yankee drying process is the most common drying method. Small gas turbines are desirable for use in the Yankee process because the demand for hot air is lower compared with the Through Air Dryer (TAD) process. TAD uses heat to dewater the product instead of the conventional mechanical pressing. This produces a much softer paper and reduces the demand for raw material from 8% to 30%, but dramatically increases the drying load. The high demand of hot air means that the implementation of gas turbines up to 10 MW is profitable for the TAD process. \nOur Pulp and Paper Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle, and allow you to exploit the opportunities of digitalization while reducing your total cost of ownership. Our services include: \nWith our solutions, we help to ensure success in the pulp and paper industry worldwide. \nAt Progroup Paper AG’s paper factory of in Sandersdorf- Brehna, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, one of the most modern paper machines (PM3) is producing high-quality containerboard from wastepaper.

The initial release to market was the TA1250; however, with various up rates throughout the years, the final release product was the TA2500 in 1983. Most of the fleet is the TA1750 with a power output of 1,810 bhp (PG) and 1,875 bhp (MD) at full load speed of 6,000 rev/min (PG) and 6,600 rev/min (MD) under ISO conditions. \nAs the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Siemens Energy Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd. benefits from a global network of expertise and designs, manufacturers, sells and offers service support products for gas turbines and their associated equipment, to suit the specific service requirements of each operator.   \nOur offerings range includes: \nThe TA is a proven unit in service for nearly 70 years for all electrical power generation; mechanical load drives, including compression and pumping for use in both industrial power generation and Oil and Gas sectors. It offers operates on a wide range of gaseous and liquid fuels. \nThere are significant number of units still in service throughout the world, in the widely varying climatic conditions of Alaska, the Americas, Europe, the Middle and Far East. \n        - Significant fleet experience \nGas Generator The axial compressor is ﬂexibly coupled to the compressor turbine and the complete rotating assembly is supported in three bearings. These are carried in the rigid stator casings, which are split horizontally along the centre line of the rotor shaft to facilitate inspection of both the rotor and stator blades and bearings. A single large diameter combustion chamber is used, capable of burning a wide range of fuels. \nCompressor The thirteen-stage compressor is a subsonic aerodynamic design with a pressure ratio of 4:1 at full load. Two sleeve bearings are used to carry the rotating assembly supported by the stator casing at the turbine end and the inlet casing at the compressor end. An anti-whirl type bearing is ﬁtted at the compressor turbine end of the assembly and thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined double acting tilting pad bearing. Separate grooved discs are clamped together with a single through bolt to make up the rotor assembly. Stator blades are retained by dovetail roots in grooves machined on the stator casing which is split on the horizontal centre line to facilitate inspection of the rotor and stator assemblies. \nCompressor Turbine The two-stage turbine which is ﬂexibly coupled to the compressor rotor, has a full load speed of approximately 12,000rev/ min.  \nPower Turbine The discs of the two-stage free power turbine and the rotor blades are manufactured from alloys to meet the engine duty. The blades are ﬁxed into the discs by the traditional ﬁr tree root method and secured by peening. The use of two stages gives low stress levels and maintains a safe overspeed capability. There are no critical speeds within the operating speed range. Two sleeve bearings support the power turbine rotor shaft which are carried in the robust gear casting to which is secured the support arm for the stator casing. Thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined tilting pad thrust bearing. \nControl system The compensating hydraulic governor, that controls the quantity of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber, is gear driven from the power turbine. It controls the turbine over the full power range and allows output speed to be controlled. Starting may be either from a 24-volt D.C. electric motor or by a gas starter motor driving through a Bendix drive on to the turbine axial compressor shaft. When operating on gaseous fuels the pilot igniter can be supplied with gas from the main fuel system via a pressure reducing valve. For engines burning liquid fuel the igniter gas supply is taken from a gas bottle or similar source of supply. The control equipment is housed in two cabinets mounted in the turbine under base, the hydraulic control cabinet housing the engine instruments, pressure switches a servo system component while the electrical control cabinet contains the associated relays, timers, wiring and terminals, the selection switches, the annunciator panel, and the T Max temperature indicator.  \nThe turbine is fitted with devices to shut down the turbine in the event of: \nIn the event of high lubricating oil temperature or high cycle temperature, a visual and audible warning is given before shutdown values are reached \nEngine Auxiliaries During starting and for the cooling period after shutdown, lubricating oil is supplied by a D.C. electric motor-driven auxiliary lubricating oil pump. The main engine pump is driven through the auxiliary gear train from the output shaft. Oil cooling is by either an air blast or water-cooled cooler to meet site requirements. The double helical gears have hardened teeth and are precision ground to ensure silent running and long working life. For direct drive to centrifugal pumps and compressors a shaft speed of 6,600 rev/min is provided. The engine is mounted on an under base with extended platforms on which the auxiliary components are installed. This also forms the lubricating oil tank. \nInspection of the internal components of the TA gas turbine is necessary only when a blade inspection is due, usually after 20,000 to 30,000 hours (3 years) running. The turbine can be rapidly opened for such inspections and can be carried out at site. The turbine rotors are retained by a single through bolt which is quickly removed to permit withdrawal of both compressor and power turbines.  \nThe page with name \"TA Industrial Gas Turbine\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/ta-industrial-gas-turbine.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Storage solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/storage-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nFor that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically. \nWhile today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.  \nToday, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs. \nBy mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed. \nStoring fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage. \nWhen it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible. \nFor ELEC, everything revolves around the topic of energy. No wonder, after all, he lives in a light bulb. Bursting with questions on the energy transition, he wants to know why storage solutions are so important on our way towards a CO₂-free economy. Watch the video for more. \nWant to see more ELEC episodes and join him on his quest for answers on the energy transition?  \nExplore more \nThe situation energy producers, distributers and industrial consumers find themselves in is by no means easy. They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets. \nAlso, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability.  \nBut a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption. The production of green hydrogen also requires renewable energy sources, but if none are available, energy still needs to be at hand to manufacture it.  \nEnergy storage solves many of these problems: \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later.\n \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later. \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher.\n \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher. \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand.\n \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand. \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators.\n \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators. \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid.\n \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid. \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities.\n \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities. \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power.\n \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power. \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production.\n \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production. \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities.\n \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities. \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units.\n \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units. \nExpertise you can count on \nWe take responsibility for the entire project, from engineering through commissioning, keeping your project on time and on budget.

Likewise, when energy is cheap, it can be stored to sell it when prices are high (so-called energy arbitrage). \nIn this white paper you will find an overview of energy storage systems and how they help us build a decarbonized energy system. \nThe page with name \"Storage solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/storage-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Coal to Gas\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/brownfield-transformation/coal-to-gas.html\" has the following content:\n75% of global CO₂ emissions in the power generation sector are caused by coal power plants. Converting coal-fired power plants into highly efficient combined cycle plants can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 70%. It also gives you the option to co-fire clean hydrogen in your gas turbine, enabling you to decarbonize your plant operation even further.  \nBased on the Brownfield Transformation concept, our approach includes repurposing as much of your existing infrastructure as possible to enable a fast transition towards a new energy system while reducing CO₂ emissions at the same time.  \nA full repowering entails not just changing the fuel from coal or oil to gas but converting the steam power plant to a highly efficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) by reusing infrastructure, site permits and local personnel. Not only is this approach faster and more sustainable but it also saves up to 30% of Capex compared to building a new power plant. \nThere are two options to repower your plant: the indoor and the outdoor approach. \nWith the indoor approach, you can reuse most of the existing infrastructure such as foundations, connections, housing and piping. This saves time and costs. With the outdoor approach, you can start building in parallel when the existing plant is still running to secure critical supplies. \nIn principle, a \"full repowering\" means that one or more gas turbines with downstream heat recovery steam generators replace the old steam generator previously fired with coal or oil. In order to achieve this, various modifications of the steam cycle are necessary, as well as the exchange and retrofit of various components.  \nFor a full repowering, one needs to make sure that the appropriate gas capacities are available. For the final plan, other factors to be considered are the plant capacity, the heat quantities, and levels to be supplied for district heating and/or process steam applications. Also, one needs to consider the space available, and the condition of the power plant. The overall aim is to keep as much of the existing infrastructure as possible.  \nWhile it is impressive that by converting a conventional coal power plant to a CCPP CO₂ emissions get reduced by up to 70%, it’s worth mentioning that this is a result not just from the fuel switch, but also from an increase in the power plant’s efficiency from an average of 38% to up to 63%. \nA boiler conversion involves a modification of the burner technology and a change of coal or oil to gas. While switching to gas as a fuel does not increase the efficiency of the steam plant, it does reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 50%. \n‘Topping’ requires the installation of a small gas turbine, regardless of whether the fuel is switched from coal to gas or not. The thermal energy contained in the flue gas of the ‘topping’ gas turbine is fed directly to the steam generator of the existing plant. This results in a slight improvement in overall plant efficiency.  \nBoosting requires the installation of an additional – usually medium – gas turbine and a waste heat boiler. In contrast to topping, the heat energy contained in the flue gas of the gas turbine is used with the aid of a heat exchanger to generate high-pressure steam and to preheat the feed water of the existing process. Boosting makes the steam power plant more flexible, while also increasing efficiency and reducing CO₂ emissions. \nParallel repowering utilizes the steam contained in the flue gas of a newly installed large gas turbine with the aid of a heat recovery steam generator for additional feedwater preheating and steam generation in the existing steam power plant process. This conversion also serves to increase the flexibility and efficiency of steam power plants, but to a greater degree than boosting. \nUnderstanding customer’s market environment, the regional energy system and regulatory framework in order to create a customized cost-optimized, efficient, or flexible solution, while aiming at the same time at integrating as many existing assets as possible. \nAnalyzing how to integrate the new equipment – such as gas turbines or generators – fit into the existing plant layout and infrastructure. Especially for indoor solutions, it’s important to analyze how existing foundations, piping and connections can be reused, while ensuring the new setup will work smoothly and safely.  \nIdentifying the best configuration with the best thermodynamic fit in order to match the future operating regime with the intended business model. This can involve various, far-reaching measures, as, e.g., the steam cycle of a conventional steam power plant differs fundamentally from that of a CCPP.  \nAdapting the existing steam turbine and generator to operating parameters of a combined cycle plant. This may concern especially higher temperatures – up to 600°C and more for a steam turbine – that modern CCPPs use today. \nIs your plant a good candidate for coal-to-gas repowering?

There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably. \nBasically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment. \nHVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime. \nThanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably. \nGrid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects. \nRefurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system.  \nThree basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies. \nHigh-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio: \nReasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components. \nSiemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan.  \nNo refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project. \nSiemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support. \nFinding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system. \nWhile regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance.  \nSiemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects. \nThe Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security. In a nutshell: Partnering with Siemens Energy makes sure that your refurbishment project will be a complete success.        \nThe page with name \"High-voltage refurbishment solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/refurbishments.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Omnivise Control Solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/omnivise-digital-solutions/control-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nToday's plants must adapt to meet challenging energy and operational demands.

As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​ \nThe ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​ \nStaying below allowed voltage fluctuations​ \nPower system equipment and loads require regulated voltage for proper operation. ​ \nStaying below critical frequency levels​ \nFrequency drift caused by fluctuations in generation or load must be mitigated. ​ \nLack of inertia​  \nAll generation resources must synchronize and remain synchronized through network disturbances.​ \nEmergency reaction​ \nSystem restoration, process of black starting and restoring the power system following a major outage.​ \nMost power electronic systems today use grid following (GFL) inverter controls. Due to their widespread use and growing installed capacity, it is important to understand the characteristics, dynamic behavior and potential contribution to grid reliability of these inverters. Both grid-forming and grid-following controls aim to supply active and reactive power to the grid.

But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically. \nWhile today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.  \nToday, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs. \nBy mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed. \nStoring fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage. \nWhen it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible. \nFor ELEC, everything revolves around the topic of energy. No wonder, after all, he lives in a light bulb. Bursting with questions on the energy transition, he wants to know why storage solutions are so important on our way towards a CO₂-free economy. Watch the video for more. \nWant to see more ELEC episodes and join him on his quest for answers on the energy transition?  \nExplore more \nThe situation energy producers, distributers and industrial consumers find themselves in is by no means easy. They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets. \nAlso, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability.  \nBut a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption. The production of green hydrogen also requires renewable energy sources, but if none are available, energy still needs to be at hand to manufacture it.  \nEnergy storage solves many of these problems: \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later.\n \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later. \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher.\n \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher. \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand.\n \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand. \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators.\n \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators. \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid.\n \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid. \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities.\n \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities. \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power.\n \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power. \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production.\n \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production. \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities.\n \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities. \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units.\n \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units. \nExpertise you can count on \nWe take responsibility for the entire project, from engineering through commissioning, keeping your project on time and on budget.

Therefore, seasonal and multi-day energy shifting is made possible, and limiting power output is avoided. \nWith the share of renewables increasing annually, the energy grid is facing challenges. By providing instant and zero-carbon energy, our storage portfolio allows grid stabilization. \nEnergy storage creates new revenue streams. For example, it allows expansion of the grid by supplying and storing energy for grid stabilization (so-called virtual grid expansion). Likewise, when energy is cheap, it can be stored to sell it when prices are high (so-called energy arbitrage). \nIn this white paper you will find an overview of energy storage systems and how they help us build a decarbonized energy system. \nPlease send us a message and we'll get back to you. \nThe page with name \"Storage solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/storage-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Refining petrochemical gas turbines\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/refining-petrochemical-gas-turbines.html\" has the following content:\nThe page with name \"Refining petrochemical gas turbines\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/refining-petrochemical-gas-turbines.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Disconnectors and switches\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/disconnectors-earthing-switches.html\" has the following content:\nLearn more about the range and technology of our high-voltage disconnectors and earthing switches.

There are numerous complementary methods for diagnosing the transformer ageing process early and reliably. The Siemens Energy Test Laboratory for Transformer Materials is completely focused on the laboratory diagnostics of oil-filled electrical equipment. The highly qualified personnel are constantly developing new methods for ageing diagnostics and are using this knowledge for the benefit of our customers. \nAccredited as an independent test laboratory in accordance with ISO 17025 (Certificate) \nOur services include insulating oil analyses and material testing. The diagnostic test procedures vary between ageing analysis or condition detection of oils /insulating materials and the new state assessments of oils /insulating materials. \nThe lifespan of a transformer largely depends on the ageing of the solid and liquid organic insulating materials. In normal operating conditions, below the maximum permissible load, and with regular maintenance and care, a transformer's lifespan can be extended to well over 30 years. \nNevertheless, during the working life of a transformer abnormal events could occur, for example transient over voltages, overheating during emergency operation, dynamic stress and faults in the cooling. These processes result in an accelerated ageing of the transformer materials. \nWhether it is a case of new construction, operation, retrofit or repair, it is always a matter of reliably recognizing material degradation and rectifying it. For this purpose an extensive knowledge of the materials as well as a specific, precise analysis is fundamental. In order to avoid costly breakdowns, minimize downtimes and extend the lifespan of a transformer, the performance of a regular trend analysis and targeted maintenance are indispensable. \nThe combination of moisture in the oil and in the cellulose is an indicator of ageing. The most important method for the diagnosis of the ageing process as a result of dielectric, thermal, dynamic and chemical ageing in oil and oil-paper insulation is the Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). The Siemens Energy Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers a comprehensive service, from the collection of samples to analysis and assessment. \nThe sampling device, developed in collaboration with the customers, offers the following advantages: \nDuring the mostly decades-long service life of a transformer, materials too are subjected to considerable ageing processes. Through our tests we are able to determine the condition of the materials, and offer our clients the possibility to plan any necessary maintenance measures early. \nAnalyses of solid insulating materials, conductive metallic materials (grain-oriented electrical steel and copper materials) as well as coating materials and sealing materials, are carried out.  \nDuring the natural aging process of the oil and insulating parts, especially in the case of thermal or electrical failures, cracked gases form, and are dissolved in the oil. The rate of decomposition and the type of gases change during defective operation, which could be a result of thermal overloading and/or electrical faults. Based on the quantity or type of fault gases, the gas increase rates and the proportions between the gases, the type of failure can be deduced. \nPartial discharges with lower energy mainly lead to the formation of hydrogen and methane, as well as small quantities of ethane. Thermal overheating results in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. In temperatures between 300-700°C ethylene and propylene accompanied by larger quantities of CO and CO2 prevail. Over 700°C mainly ethylene, propylene and hydrogen form, and above 1000°C acetylene are also formed. Electrical discharges (arcs and spark discharges) cause separation of hydrogen and acetylene, as well as methane and ethylene. By thermal-oxidative cellulose degradation, larger quantities of CO and CO2 are formed. \nThrough DGA mainly slowly developing faults can be detected. The gradual development of gas concentration allows for a trend analysis, which in turn makes it possible to make a prognosis on the lifespan of the transformer. The following failure sources can also be understood by means of DGA: \n The following cannot be detected by means of DGA:  \nThe maintenance of insulating liquids is based on IEC norm, VDE 0370 part 2 (= IEC 60422). This norm is valid for oils that are already contained in transformers. For new oil the norm VDE 0370 part 1 (= IEC 60296) is valid. \nThe following oil values are decisive for the regulation of measures: \nThe color and appearance of transformer oil are useful for comparative evaluation: a quick color darkening or dark oil is a sign of oil ageing. The analyzed oil color is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 8, whereby the level of discoloration is indicated by means of the rising color number.  \nBy analyzing the appearance, undesirable by-products can be detected. Cloudiness or sediment indicate free water, insoluble sludge or dirt particles. If these are present, then also the breakdown voltage and/or the loss factor and eventually also other oil values are out of the norm and measures must be taken. \nThe breakdown voltage (Ud) indicates how well insulating oil can withstand an electrical load and is therefore decisive for the operational efficiency of a transformer. The breakdown voltage is measured according to VDE 0370 part 5 (=IEC 60156). The initial measures to be taken in case of a drop below the insulation voltage limit values of the relative transformer type, depend on the values of the other characteristic oil values. \nWater formation is caused by the ageing of cellulose- insulating material (paper, pressboard, laminated wood), ageing of oil and infiltration of humidity from the environment by means of badly maintained air dryers and/or defective sealing systems. \nThere is an equilibrium between the water content in oil and the moisture content in the solid insulation, it reduces the breakdown voltage and accelerates the ageing process. This equilibrium though, is temperature and time-dependent. \nAs there is never an even temperature in an operating transformer, -oil temperature in the tank is much higher at the top than at the bottom, and the same counts for the temperature distribution in the windings – the moisture distribution curves are only a rough estimate. In the moisture distribution curves the water content in the oil can theoretically be distinguished from the moisture content in the cellulose, based on the temperature. This is however valid only for insulation paper and not for pressboard and laminated wood.  A precondition is constant temperature and a set equilibrium. \nThrough progressive ageing (Oxidation) of the oil, polar decomposition products develop. These deteriorate the dielectric properties of the oil. The result of far advanced oil ageing is sludge formation. Sludge greatly compromises the windings because it leads to the formation of sediments, which prevent heat removal. This heat accumulation in turn causes the winding paper to age intensely. A timely diagnosis of the incipient acid formation is therefore important, so that timely counteractive measures can be initiated. \nLiterature: Cigre Brochure D1.30 – „Oxidation Stability of Insulating Fluids“ \nThe dielectric dissipation factor of an insulating material is the tangent of the dielectric loss angle. \nThe dielectric loss angle, is the angle in which the phase difference between the applied voltage and consequential current diverges from π/2 rad, when the capacitor's dielectric comprises only of insulating material. \nA rising dissipation factor is an indication of oil ageing or oil contamination. The dissipation factor is strongly influenced by polar components and is therefore a very sensitive parameter. \nIn addition to the neutralization value and the dissipation factor, interfacial tension is another indicator of sludge formation in the transformer. This test measures the concentration of polar molecules in oil, which form during the ageing process. The higher the concentration, the lower the interfacial tension and the likelier it is for the insulating oil to form sludge. \nInhibitors are age protecting agents which delay the decomposition of the insulating oil. The IEC 60296 accredited inhibitor DBPC (Di-tertiary-butyl-para-cresol), with a weight percentage of 0.25 ± 0.040 , is used. Inhibited oils are preferred for transformers > 200 MVA, for heavily loaded transformers such as traction transformers, for oven transformers or at special customer request. When the accelerated oil ageing process is caused by a transformer malfunction, the original inhibitor content (0,3), can be restored by adding a calculated amount of DBPC in powder form, once the failure has been fixed. Even in the case of normal DBPC- deterioration, the oil can be re-inhibited, although an oil change would be less expensive. This decision can be made only based on the results of the other oil value tests: if these are normal then a re-inhibition can be successful. The inhibitor content is determined using infrared spectrometry or gas chromatography with MS-detector. \nThe decomposition of paper is caused by the processes of hydrolysis, pyrolysis and oxidation. The degree of polymerization (DP-value) of paper was defined by IEC 60450 and it counts the number of polymerized glucose rings. During the paper decomposition, the DP-value is reduced and the tensile strength decreases. New cellulose has a DP-value of 1000-1100, aged cellulose on the other hand has a value of only 150-200, which means the end of the transformer's lifespan. \nAs it is not possible to take paper samples during running operation, the condition of the solid insulation is estimated based on the cellulose decomposition products (2- Furfural). For this purpose a regular trend analysis is necessary. \nThe furan content in oil depends on: \nAn exact link between the furan content and DP-value cannot be deduced at present. However it is possible to make a trend analysis: based on the change of the furan content, information about thermal conduct of the solid insulation over the years can be obtained. \nThe testing and approval of new insulating liquids, or mineral oils, synthetic or natural ester or silicone liquids is also part of the laboratory's work. \nUsing our computer controlled and monitored oxidation equipment we are able to set and monitor the test conditions much more precisely than is required by the standard specifications. The result is a much better reproducibility and safe assessment. \nThe solid insulating materials in the windings include purified cellulose solid materials like pressboard and insulating paper as well as bonded laminates (e.g. laminated board, various fiber- reinforced synthetic materials). \nIn the material testing laboratory the physical properties of these materials are tested, hence verifying their applicability for transformer construction. \nThe following tests are carried out: \nTransformer cores are made up of grain-oriented electrical steel. There are three different qualities: conventional grain-oriented steel, highly permeable grain-oriented steel and domain refined electrical steel. \nIn the material testing laboratory the following tests are carried out on the grain-oriented electrical steel: \nCopper materials are mainly used in the windings and in the leads as single flat conductors, multiple flat conductors and continuously transposed conductors. The condition of the enamel paint and of the paper wrapping is decisive for safe transformer operation. \nThe following tests are carried out on copper materials: \nThe tank, tank cover, manhole cover and valves of a transformer are sealed using sealing materials that are resistant to insulating liquid, for example: \nOutside coating materials are used as corrosion protection for tanks, radiators, coolers and other construction parts. Interior coatings on the other hand are used to protect the transformer from possible metal particle contamination. \nThe main coating materials used are environmentally friendly. These can be for example, water-based, “High Solid” or cathodic dip coating. \nIn the material testing laboratory we inspect the condition of the coating using the following procedures: \nAdhesives, cast resins, desiccants, glide waves and detergents are only some of the numerous auxiliary materials used in transformer production or repair. The behavior of each of these auxiliary materials must be understood to the smallest detail, particularly in their interaction with other materials. We therefore test the adhesion of glues, the adsorption behavior of desiccants and the compatibility of different auxiliary materials with insulating liquids. \nSiemens Energy Transformers Chemical-physical material testing laboratory Katzwanger Str. 150 90461 Nürnberg, Germany E-Mail: testlab.energy@siemens-energy.com   \nCustomer Support Phone: +49 911 6505 6505 E-Mail: support@siemens-energy.com \nThe page with name \"Test Laboratory for Transformer Materials\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/test-laboratory-for-transformer-materials.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"FPSO Production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/oil-gas/fpso-oil-gas.html\" has the following content:\nOptimizing the lifecycle performance of floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels is highly contingent on the incorporation of topsides packages that can efficiently and reliably deliver the power to exploit resources in a range of water depths and operating conditions.

The thermal energy in the hot exhaust gas is recovered through a Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU), using an organic fluid as the heat exchange medium. The hot organic fluid is used to power an ORC-turbine and generator to generate additional electricity. This combined cycle characterizes itself with simplicity compared to a water-/steam-cycle, at the same time completely eliminating the need for water at all. \nThe Organic Rankine Cycle's principle is based on a turbogenerator working as a conventional steam turbine to transform thermal energy into mechanical energy and finally into electrical energy through an electrical generator. Instead of generating steam from water, the ORC system vaporizes an organic fluid, characterized by a molecular mass higher than that of water, which leads to a slower rotation of the turbine, lower pressures and no erosion of the metal parts and blades. \nThe Heat ReCycle range of power plants provides a wide choice of different industrial and aeroderivative gas turbines. The power plant can be customized for the required project-specific boundaries, such as power output and operating load regime. Heat ReCycle power plant configurations are possible from roughly 10 to almost 100 MWe capacity. \nThe 3 x SGT-400 Heat ReCycle reference configuration is used as an example for explaining this new power plant in further detail. Having a three-on-one (3 gas turbines on 1 ORC turbine) configuration in the typical 50-MW capacity size range enables operational flexibility. Especially for remote locations, the 50-MW size range has traditionally been served by reciprocating engines or simple cycle gas turbines. Now, Heat ReCycle offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative, while providing a great deal of flexibility through this multi-unit set-up.  \nThe total power plant output of this configuration is in the range of roughly 52 - 58 MW, depending on the GT version and project conditions. See more plant details in the below table: \nThe Heat ReCycle 3 x SGT-400 configuration provides flexible, reliable and affordable power while complying with the most stringent emissions standards globally. The multi-unit set-up allows for a great deal of flexibility and plant part load capability while also reaching high efficiencies with the ORC bottoming-cycle. This 50 MW-range power plant is unique in its kind and is competitive against reciprocating engines in the same power range. The benefits include a very high power-density, attractive CAPEX, and better LCoE than similar power solutions for intermediate to base load power generation. \nThe SGT-400 is a simple, robust twin-shaft gas turbine, suitable for all climates and serves a power band of 10 – 15 MW. The SGT-400 is a leader in operational and fuel flexibility, low emissions, and overall efficiency. A wide range of fuel compositions can be burned while running efficiently at all loads. The turbine can meet stringent emission standards while operating as low as 30% load, and has seamless, true dual-fuel capability. With more than 390 units installed all over the globe and more than 5 million actual operating hours, it is an excellent fit to the Heat ReCycle power plant.  \nThe Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU) offers an efficient method of recovering thermal energy from the waste heat of gas turbine exhaust gases. Unlike a traditional Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), the WHRU is a single stage system using a once-through principle and is therefore less complex. The WHRU has been completely optimized around the gas turbine and is charaterized by its highly modular design for optimal constructability. The complete WHRU can be installed in less than 6 weeks and offers the lowest total installed cost. \nFor more information on Heat ReCycle power plant solutions, please get in touch with our experts. \nThe page with name \"Heat ReCycle solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/heat-recycle-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Benson technology\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/benson-technology.html\" has the following content:\nBenson technology is a proven process for large-scale steam generation in power plants. The heart of this process is the once-through principle. Combined with sliding pressure operation, this allows for highly efficient, flexible, and reliable power plant operation. Our Benson technology and our associated Benson license will improve your specific steam generator and, consequently, benefit your power plant performance. Find out more below or contact us.  \nA new Benson HP evaporator design for vertical-exhaust-gas-flow heat recovery steam generators – deployed for the first time in the 24 HRSGs of the Siemens Energy H-class Egypt Megaproject – has proved highly successful. Commissioning and operation have been trouble free, thanks to innovative design features and simulation-based prior optimisation of the all-important Benson-specific feed-water controller.  \nSince 1933 leading steam generator manufacturers have constructed Benson steam generators worldwide under Siemens Energy Benson license. Today, our Benson technology is widely used in fired steam generators and heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) of highly efficient modern power plants. \nToday combined cycle gas power plants need to be more efficient and flexible than ever, because they have to both \nThis is where Benson HRSGs make an important contribution. The unique once-through design enables fast flexible start up of a combined cycle, while maintaining high cycle efficiency. Benson HRSGs can be constructed either horizontally or vertically and will fit into any power plant architecture.   \nBenefits compared with drum-type steam generators \nThe first combined cycle power plant with a Benson heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) – the 390-MW Cottam CDC, located in Great Britain – was successfully commissioned in 1999. More than 100 Benson heat-recovery steam generators have been commissioned to date or are currently under construction. \nThe overall efficiency of a steam power plant counts in every respect, whether it’s reducing emissions or increasing economic efficiency. The best way to boost efficiency is by selecting high steam parameters. The once-through principle permits steam generation even at supercritical pressure. To date Benson boilers have been built for pressures up to 310 bar. \nContribution to flexible power plant operation \nThe Benson steam generator is especially well suited to flexible sliding-pressure operation: A steam power plant with a Benson steam generator can sustain load transients of four to six percent per minute over a wide power output range. High plant efficiency is ensured even at part load. \nSophisticated construction ­– individually optimized \nBenson steam generators can be precisely adapted to suit your firing conditions: Different furnace sizes and geometries can be used depending on the fuel used. An important factor here is that the functions on the water/steam side are not restricted. Benson steam generators have been constructed with the broadest possible range of firing systems, including fluidized bed combustion. \nLately, the Benson steam generator with vertical rifled tubes has been successfully established in the market. Based on the Benson Low Mass Flux Design, this type of steam generator combines outstanding operating characteristics with low investment costs and high levels of reliability. \nMore than 1,300 Benson fired steam generators have been commissioned to date. \nBenson steam generators have outstanding operating characteristics and are extremely reliable – thanks to continuous research and development. And we are refining the technology even more: We’re working intensively to optimize the heat transfer, pressure drop, and flow stability of two phase flows in evaporator tubes. Siemens Energy has its own Benson test rig for the trials. The results of the trials have led to the creation of the world’s largest database on heat transfer and pressure drop in evaporator tubes, and support the development and validation of the Siemens Eenrgy Benson design software. \nAnother key area of focus is the development of Benson-specific control concepts, which make a key contribution to ensuring the best possible operation of your particular system. \nIn 1925, Siemens acquired the right to use Benson's patent, and in 1926–27 the first large Benson boiler in Berlin-Gartenfeld was built. Siemens improved the technology and developed it as an internationally acknowledged standard for large steam generators. In 1933, Siemens decided that it would no longer manufacture steam generators in its facilities, but would instead award licenses based on its own patents and expertise. This story goes still further: \nThe Siemens Energy Benson license is available for fired steam generators as well as for heat-recovery steam generators. It primarily addresses the thermodynamic and thermo-hydraulic design of the evaporator system in Benson steam generators.  \nBasically, the license comprises the following components: \nIn addition to providing the Benson license, we also advise utilities on questions related to the evaporator system of once-through steam generators. \nThis is where you can find downloads to the services we offer. \n24 vertical triple-pressure Benson heat-recovery steam generatorsPart of the megaproject designed to increase electricity generation in Egypt by 50 percentHighly efficient and flexible combined cycle operation \nSecond follow-up order from customer for a highly flexible system from SiemensTwo horizontal Benson HRSGs for the multi-shaft system guarantee a high level of flexibility in operationOffsets fluctuations in feed-in from renewables \nTwo horizontal Benson heat-recovery steam generatorsFollowing units 1, 2 and 3, the fourth combined cycle power plant Dangjin 4 supplies more than 900 MWEco-friendly electricity to more than 900,000 people \nGive your steam generator a boost.

Our engineered expertise is unrivaled in meeting the ever changing needs of EPCs and Owner Operators who are now rethinking how to manage the entire life-cycle of their assets. Siemens Energy has developed Topsides 4.0 - a comprehensive digital life-cycle approach designed to help offshore operators harness the full power of digital transformation for rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, and automation systems. This all starts with digitally configuring solutions jointly with our clients during the conceptual and design phases of their projects, progresses through manufacturing to virtual testing. All delivering an intelligent digital twin of the topsides facility for life cycle decision support and asset optimization. This effectively enables our clients to maximize the performance of critical equipment, and do end-to-end asset optimization. \nTopsides 4.0 is a digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems that begins during the conceptual and design phase of a project with the development of a comprehensive digital roadmap. It is during this time that we evaluate how the operator is using data, where the gaps are, and how to best fill them. With that knowledge, Siemens Energy collaborates with the operator and tailors a solution to meet their specific needs. \nTopsides 4.0 is designed to help offshore operators realize the full potential of Industry 4.0 and overcome the risks that are inherent in offshore projects by reducing capital and operating costs and shortening facility development cycles. This is achieved through digital project management and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent “Digital Twin” of the topsides facility, which can be used by operators for decision-making support and asset optimization. \nDigital solutions have long been applied in other industries to improve efficiency and productivity. The oil and gas industry, however, is just starting to begin its digital transformation. In offshore oil and gas production, many operators are beginning to discover the massive potential digitalization has to offer. \nThe foundation of Topsides 4.0 is the workflow and data integration of solutions that Siemens Energy has successfully delivered to the oil and gas industry over many years. Although the integrated approach is new, the digital solutions that comprise it have a proven track record of success. \nIntegral to the Topsides 4.0 approach is the creation of an intelligent digital twin, which is constructed in parallel to the physical topsides during the design and build phases of the project. The digital twin’s intelligence derives from the capability to interpret raw data through a variety of analytics, some of which are automated and others that are offered as an OEM service. The automated analytics are independent of an equipment vendor and based on statistical analysis of real-time data from the instrumentation and automation system.  For critical equipment, such as compressors and turbines, this layer of monitoring can be supplemented with OEM-connected services for predictive diagnostics, spare parts management, and outage planning. \nThe digital twin is more than a design tool; it’s more than a punch list of parts to fabricate, and it’s more than the 3D model. It’s the joining of the physical and digital worlds as the asset moves through the three phases of a project: FEED and design, configure and build, operate and maintain.  \nCOMOS Walkinside allows operators to create a series of real-life scenarios in which employees can literally see and experience the tasks they will be required to perform. They can virtually look around, listen, practice, and learn operational procedures at zero financial or physical risk to themselves or the operator. For example, maintenance personnel can view where equipment is located, if it is accessible from the floor, or if scaffolding or a crane is necessary, all in a 3D digital space. Using the link with the COMOS platform, they can directly access equipment characteristics, maintenance history, and documentation by clicking through on the equipment in the 3D view. \nThe use of a single engineering data hub is a key enabler for digitalization and Topsides 4.0. With appropriate IT security measures, engineering and maintenance contractors, equipment and other providers can all share the as-built and as-maintained data image of the plant. Instead of delivering and attempting to maintain hard copy documentation, the different stakeholders deliver and update their MRB as data records, which simplifies and expedites the process substantially. This creates complete transparency of information for each plant object and ultimately optimizes the design process. \nThe digital revolution has led to significant performance improvements for producers who are harnessing data-driven solutions; however, despite the largely positive developments, connecting critical equipment to cloud-based platforms does mean that the oil and gas industry must be prepared to respond to an evolving security landscape in which cyber threats are the norm. This is particularly critical when extending the operation of the platform to an onshore location, as is the case with Topsides 4.0. \nA key differentiator of Topsides 4.0 is that all electrical, instrumentation, control, and telecommunications (EICT) systems and equipment are integrated into one cybersecure solution. The EICT design establishes a resilient, reliable, and scalable system backbone and architecture to enable safe operation of the topsides facility from an onshore control center.  \nThe SGT-750 delivers lowest total cost of ownership by reducing fuel costs, maintenance operations and outages. With best-in-class performance, a compact, lightweight design, and the lowest carbon footprint and emissions in the market, with single digit NOx over a wide load range. \nSiemens solutions provide data continuity from early phase concept to end of operational life.

The first three turbine stages are thermal barrier-coated. Your benefit: long service life and low maintenance.  \nThe SGT5-4000F offers dual fuel capability and tolerates fuels within a wide Wobbe range. You might need to adjust the burner configuration when the Wobbe index of the fuel gas varies by more than ±15%.   The SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to handle different fuel compositions, e.g. natural gas with high contents on hydrogen (up to 30 vol%), propane, ethylene and butane, as well as inert gases (N2, CO2, He, Ar, etc.). Furthermore, the SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to run on fuels with higher amounts of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) of up to 4000 ppm. The fuel system can switch over quickly between fuel gas and fuel oil and vice versa.  \nWet Compression option Wet Compression (WetC) increases the power output by injecting water into the gas turbine inlet. This optional SGT5-4000F feature can be used for peak-load machines to benefit from high electricity prices WetC enhances the turbine performance by reducing compressor inlet temperatures and increasing the mass flow throughout the turbine. Excess fog droplets evaporate in the compressor and produce an additional intercooling effect. \nChiller System option The chiller is a heat exchanger, which cools down the compressor intake air in order to increase the gas turbine base load performance. The system can decrease the compressor inlet temperature far below the dew point of the ambience. A chiller system can generate benefits in dry regions, where the high water consumption of other inlet air cooling options is undesirable. \nEvaporative Cooling option The system decreases compressor inlet temperature through humidification, raises relative humidity and increases the air mass flow, resulting in higher turbine output power and efficiency. Evaporative cooling is the favorable system in dry and hot ambient. \nWith its high steam raising capability, the SGT5-4000F is excellently suited for cogeneration or combined heat an power (CHP) applications, e.g, for \nFor combined cycle applications with CHP, you can use a condensing or backpressure steam turbine, with or without steam extraction. \nThe SGT5-4000F entered the market in 1996.

Internal cooling air passages reduce the stress on critical components and ensure a long service life. \nVariable inlet guide vanes plus two stages of fast-acting variable-pitch guide vanes (VGV) improve the part load efficiency and optimize the performance over a wide range of operating conditions. \nOn-board valves provide controlled cooling air supply with low cooling air consumption, leading to high efficiency. \nThe gas turbine package for the SGT5-4000F consists of the core turbine, the generator (SGen5-2000P or SGen5-2000H) and auxiliary systems. We offer you a standardized basic design with options geared to your specific requirements. By using standard components and preassembly or prepackaging we achieve short installation times, with staggered delivery and early shipment of main components. We group subsystems and install them in separate auxiliary packages to minimize field assembly. \nDesigned for short installation times, all package piping is prefabricated to minimize pipe cleaning and welding on site. \nPackage footprint: \nThe air intake is suitable for different multistage filters, e.g., pre-filter, fine- and/or HEPA filter or self-cleaning pulse filter systems, which secure operation even at harsh ambient conditions (e.g., sandy, dusty or polluted). The use of an air intake silencer significantly reduces the pressure drop with improved noise reduction, thus ensuring compliance with noise protection regulations. Anti-icing systems and inlet air cooling with evaporative cooler are available as an option. \nSGT5-4000F-based combined cycle plants have the capability for fast start-up. With these plants, you can achieve combined cycle base load in less than 30 min for hot start. High load gradients allow for fast load changes.

Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.        \nOur ideas grow from experience: In 1866, Werner von Siemens developed the first electric generator, and Siemens Energy built the first power plant in 1885. This spirit of invention is what has driven our power business ever since. Since 1990, we`ve brought more than a hundred turnkey power plants online, supplying hundreds of GW of electricity. Each of them has been constructed with customized solutions to meet our customers’ individual challenges. In other words, we’ve always been involved in supplying electricity to industries, regions, and people all over the world. That’s our purpose. Let’s make tomorrow different today! \nWe have the most extensive in-house technology portfolio on the market, which allows us to choose the most appropriate products to incorporate into your solution. That  allows you to benefit from our expertise as an OEM EPC and from the certainty of one-stop procurement – for every one of your projects. \nSustainability for your power plant project: EHS measures minimize the risks \nHealth and safety are our top priority – for our own employees and those of our suppliers and partners. That’s why we work with management plans and assessments, and that’s why we train and test everyone involved. We regularly visit sites and evaluate the commitment of each individual participant, whether they’re in the office or at the construction site – with one clear goal: to keep people safe from harm. Our EHS (environment, health, and safety) measures significantly cut accident rates and downtime. And in the end, they pay off for your project: with a positive transfer of knowledge to your local team, faster completion, reduced non-conformance-costs (NCCs), and a good reputation. \nLowering CO₂ by using hydrogen for power generation \nNew gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability.  However, today’s new power plants will typically start operating with natural gas for several years. \nIt is therefore crucial to build new natural gas fired power plants that can easily be upgraded and converted to hydrogen operations as hydrogen becomes available to the operator. By doing so, natural gas fired power plants are future-proof and will be fit to meet the amount of hydrogen for which it has been made ready, with minimal conversion costs. \nYou can choose between different scopes of supply – from core turbine only, gas turbine packages up to complete gas-fired power plants. \nPackage \nPower island \nPower core \nTurnkey power plant \nMore than 1,500 Siemens Energy power plants are in operation around the world.

Pressurized air-cooled generators are replacing indirectly hydrogen-cooled machines to significantly reduce plant complexity. They achieve efficiency and power levels comparable to indirectly hydrogen-cooled generators with ratings of up to 560 MVA. Pressurized air-cooled generators are used in simple cycle, combined cycle, and steam power plants, as well as in synchronous condensing applications. \nCombining GVPI stators with water cooling technology enables uniform temperatures and low stress levels to enhance operational flexibility. The proven reliability is greater than 99.9% for more than 1,700 stator windings between 10 and 22 kV with an output of up to 650 MVA. Our fleet leader has over 150,000 operating hours and 3,320 start/stop cycles. \nModern grids require high operational flexibility because of the increased integration of renewable energy sources. Our design supports high ramp-up/down rates and frequent start/stop cycles while keeping thermal mechanical stress in the stator windings low. \nOur proven MICALASTIC® insulation system and Global Vacuum Pressure Impregnation (GVPI) technology ensure maximum electrical endurance and outstanding availability.   \nThe absence of hydrogen gas reduces the complexity of auxiliaries as well as the cost of service and operation. There is no need for hazardous operational areas around the generator. Arriving almost fully assembled, the generator is designed for easy on-site installation and includes many provisions for accessible maintenance.  \nOur generators maintain a high level of common parts across the portfolio (e.g. stator core assembly and rotor). The part and component re-use improves the availability of spare parts and increases the quality in manufacturing and assembling components from our suppliers, at our factory, as well as on site. \nThe SGen-2000P generator offers an innovative mix of verified design features in operating ranges typically reserved for hydrogen-cooled generators. The water-cooled stator and air pressurization system allow this series of generators to operate within an extended performance range and with maximum load-shift flexibility. \nDepending on load demand, the generator is automatically pressurized up to 1 bar (gauge) to control rotor temperature within industry standards. \nWater-cooled stator bars minimize thermal-mechanical stresses in the end winding allowing for unlimited operational flexibility across the design power range. \nThe SGen-2000P implements technology featuring the latest verified design with more than 1,700 GVPI stators in operation across all operating ranges and a fleet-leading water-cooled GVPI stator with over 151,000 hours of operation and more than 3,320 start/stop cycles with no indication of thermal-mechanical stress-related issues. Without the application of hydrogen, the SGen-2000P series offers you the added benefit of unstaffed operation, e.g. for synchronous condenser applications. \nOur patented MICALASTIC® insulation system using GVPI is highly resistant to mechanical and thermal stresses while featuring excellent electrical properties. \nOur patent-pending load-dependent air pressurization system enables rotor cooling during flexible operating conditions. \nThe SGen-2000P generator series was designed for simplified service and maintenance. Along with eliminating hydrogen-related generator auxiliaries, various service-friendly design solutions have been implemented. Its components have been tried and tested over decades of operation, achieving a reliability rate of more than 99.9%. To minimize downtime, the maintenance intervals have been aligned with those of the prime mover and now allow for longer intervals between servicing than ever before. The rotor is designed for lifetime operation without removal for service. \nOur generators arrive on site almost fully assembled with the rotor installed – a design feature that simplifies the installation process. Our certified engineers have extensive experience in commissioning and help you to achieve faster start-up times and smooth operation. The SGen-2000P is designed for easy access. The many manholes installed allow for the majority of maintenance to be completed requiring very little generator disassembly. \nBesides standard inspection scopes and intervals, you also have the option of implementing a condition-based maintenance plan using customized installed instrumentation, component analytics, and a remaining life counter for better predictions.

Automated processes are key to building high-quality, robust generators that operate reliably for you. \nOur SGen-2000P series combines two proven technologies in one innovative concept. The generator operates with air up to 560 MVA and features variable pressurization with water-cooled stator windings. This enables the flexible operation demanded by today's evolving electrical grids. By eliminating hydrogen gas auxiliary systems, the SGen-2000P series' operating and maintenance costs are lower than those of traditional hydrogen-cooled products in this output class. \nDirectly water-cooled stator bars protect against thermal-mechanical stress-related issues that are challenging for indirectly cooled coils in a highly cyclic environment. \nThe SGen-2000P eliminates all hydrogen-related systems – seal oil, hydrogen and inert gas systems – maintaining only a pressurized air skid and a stator water system. Thereby, the hazardous system requirements that applied to the use of hydrogen are avoided – another huge benefit for our customers. \nFlexible gas and steam power plants will remain a key component of a demand-driven power supply. They form the solid foundation of a diverse and clean energy mix – indispensable for meeting the world's current and future challenges. Our pressurized air-cooled generators complement the turbine packages of any manufacturer and meet grid and environmental requirements as well as your individual needs. \nOur generators can be flexibly integrated into combined cycle power plants or steam tailing applications. \nWe supply generators for large simple or combined cycle power plants, suitable for peak, intermediate or base load duty, as well as cogeneration applications. \nRotating synchronous condensers are a proven, reliable solution for ancillary grid services guaranteeing frequency and voltage stability, plus the ability to ride through grid disturbances. Today’s emerging power systems are dominated by converter connected renewable power producers which are susceptible to decreased short circuit power and system inertia, making them more sensitive to electrical faults and sudden load imbalances. Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues. \nSynchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid. \nA synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events. \nYou would like a brochure, are interested in technical details or further information?

Managing a microgrid with multiple different decentralized resources requires a hybrid microgrid controller to provide automated and at the same time optimal operation for the customer. \nOmnivise Hybrid Control is the perfect solution for large and mid-size microgrids, e.g., for IPPs, islands, industries, data centers, mines. \nIntegrating large amount of renewable resources (PV, wind) on islands and remote areas which rely on conventional diesel generation can reduce overall fuel and operational costs. \nThis however requires integration of additional energy storage (batteries, H₂) in a microgrid to ensure the reliable and stable power supply. \nRenewable resources (PV, wind, green H₂) and batteries can be well integrated with existing and new combined cycle power plants in a microgrid to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the overall system efficiency. \nWith increasing cost of electricity and at the same time demand, C&I customers can install own generation to reduce their energy bills, and at the same time be able to run their essential load in off-grid mode. With CHPs and CCPs thermal energy is extracted for industrial processes, heating/cooling or electricity recuperation. With integration of rooftop PV, CO₂ emissions are reduced. \nThe Omnivise Hybrid Control solution has proven its performance in installations all around the globe.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid. \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues. \nBy Frank Jossi \nIn line with shared commitments to decarbonize, National Grid and Siemens Energy are teaming up to undertake a cutting-edge upgrade of a National Grid substation using Siemens Energy designed fluorinated gas free “Blue circuit breakers” with clean air insulation and vacuum switching technology. \nWhile we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nOur dead tank breaker family is available for applications from 72.5 kV up to 550 kV and for short-circuit interruption up to 90 kA.

Using a Thermal Digital Twin based on data from the DCS for advanced control concepts without major changes to mechanical equipment is one of the options to increase your plants profitability. \nWith Omnivise Performance you can adapt plant operations to your current requirements. \nGT Auto Tuner is an AI-based solution for gas turbines that uses a digital twin to optimize the turbine inlet temperature and emissions with the help of reinforcement learning. \nThe turbine inlet temperature is estimated accurately by performing online energy balance in real time. Goal of the improved turbine inlet temperature control is to compensate the power degradation (performance recovery) in combination with a continuous real time optimization of emissions and combustor dynamics.  \nA new package of enhanced energy services from Siemens Energy will supply Dubai Electricity and Water Authority’s (DEWA) Jebel Ali L2 power and water station with the latest advancements in power plant service, maintenance, and controls. Under terms of the new long-term service agreement, Siemens Energy will supply an intelligent controller for each of the four SGT5-4000F gas turbines, the latest Omnivise T3000 control system, services for generators, as well as added upgrades for outage reduction and operational flexibility. \nGT Auto Tuner improves combustion control and further minimizes seasonal tuning by supplementing the Omnivise T3000 controls with a trained reinforcement learning control policy together with a direct engine temperature control method. \nChanges in ambient conditions and exhaust back pressure can result in different combustion visible in modified dynamics and emission levels. \nPatented reinforcement learning (RL) methods extract existent dependencies into a neural network based RL control policy that is continuously adjusting the combustion process.  \nField experience demonstrated the potential to lower NOx emissions and minimize the need for seasonal tuning based on the combination of AI and improved turbine inlet temperature estimation.  \nVolkmar Sterzing and Steffen Udluft of Siemens Energy Corporate Technology developed a process that uses just a few recorded data to teach machines to regulate complex processes on their own. The continuous fine-tuning of the combustion valves has optimized gas turbine operations in terms of emissions and wear by constantly searching for the best solution in real time. \nBefore it went into practical use, Volkmar Sterzing and the team at the Berlin gas turbine plant thoroughly tested the GT Auto Tuner. \nThe scope includes the control logic that is required for autonomous optimization. Depending on individual project requirements, it can also include controls hardware as well as additional instrumentation.  \nThe Stability/Emissions Functionality autonomously introduces refinements to the fuel distribution and outlet temperature control in order to drive emissions and combustion dynamics towards optimal values in both steady state and transient operation. \nIt allows real time combustion tuning by fuel staging optimization and continuously optimized fuel fraction control for the given load.  \nThis autonomous combustion control helps to significantly reduce NOₓ emissions.  \nThe Performance Functionality allows real time gas turbine performance modelling to improve engine performance by compensating detrimental effects to temperature control set point (OTC). \nThis partial degradation recovery functionality integrates physics-based Real Time Thermal Modeling (RTTM), a software library calculating turbine inlet temperature (TIT) in real time on site. Adjustments are made autonomously at baseload to maintain the RTTM-calculated TIT to the predefined TIT set point.   \nThe page with name \"GT Auto Tuner\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/service/gt-autotuner.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Circuit breakers\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/circuit-breakers.html\" has the following content:\nWith our Blue portfolio of innovative switchgear technology, you can reduce your global warming impact to zero.

Factors resulting from interconnections and power networks to aging equipment and the declining pool of technical experts add to the challenge. \nTap-changers are very important components in transformers and the power grid. As they are of mechanical construction, they cause concern due to their maintenance needs and their failure probability. It is, therefore, important to ensure the integrity of tap-changers as cost-effectively and reliably as possible. Moreover, reports from international studies made by, for example, CIGRE show that faults associated with tap-changers are the origin of up to one-third of the transformer failures in service. \nWhen you evaluate the liability of a single tap changer failure at today’s costs, establishing an effective maintenance strategy becomes a matter no one can ignore. Hitachi Energy offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to effectively maintain many manufacturers’ tap changers, including ABB, Westinghouse, Reinhausen, Moloney, GE, National Industri, and others. Our tap changer program can supplement existing in-house programs or work independently to satisfy the total maintenance need. The Hitachi Energy tap-changer team provides support 24/7, and all field services are furnished by Hitachi Energy's qualified technicians and engineers. \nFor services ranging from documentation and design engineering to the latest in testing and oil processing to providing 100 percent OEM grade parts and life extension kits, Hitachi Energy is the best resource for all tap changer service requirements. \nOur tap-changer services increase transformer life and reliability and lower maintenance and operating costs. In order to further assist our customers, Hitachi Energy offers a wide range of monitoring and diagnostic tools, from the simple way to monitor the temperature difference between the LTC/OLTC and the transformer main tank to the most advanced solutions on the market, for example, CoreTec™. This will allow a more refined diagnosis of LTC/OLTC problems to predict maintenance/overhaul needs based on actual conditions and not on the number of switching operations. \nIn order to further lower maintenance and operating costs, Hitachi Energy has introduced a plug-and-play concept. This means the possibility of upgrading an old oil-breaking tap changer's type UCG and UCL to vacuum technology. A work that is as easy as normal maintenance. \nThe page with name \"Tap-changer Overhaul and Upgrades | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade/tap-changer-overhaul-and-upgrade\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Smart grid and urban substations | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/smart-grid-and-urban-substations\" has the following content:\nBuilding new transformer substations in inner-city zones or expanding existing facilities is a challenge due to space-constraints, low acceptance by the local community, as well as various environmental and noise restrictions. \nHitachi Energy's indoor and underground substations are compact solutions, designed to blend in with their surroundings, and almost unnoticeable to the general public.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

Hitachi Energy experts help customers select the most appropriate solution in each situation. Based on the statistical contribution to the total loss of service or loss of revenue, the algorithm ranks substation assets from low to high importance. \nUsing asset-specific checklists, a Hitachi Energy expert assesses the condition of assets and collects information about a substation’s operational experience. No outage is required, so operations are not affected. \nAdvanced Hitachi Energy remote support solutions are available to support the on-site assessment remotely, or to reach in-house specialists for an in-depth analysis of critical assets. On top, the assessment can be combined with a 3D Scan to generate the foundation for a digital representation of the system. \nCombining the importance analysis with the results of a condition assessment, assets are placed in a risk matrix that illustrates the individual contribution of each one to overall risk. This helps to define recommendations that will give due priority to high risk equipment and achieve the most effective means of reducing system risk. \nHitachi Energy will recommend interventions that are tailored to the calculated risks and needs. For example, a replacement/overhaul plan will improve the substation’s condition and reduce probability of failure; upgrading substation design and its redundancies will help reduce the negative impact of failures on operations. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"RelScan | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/substation-services/advanced-services/reliability-space/relscan\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Data center electrification | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/data-center-electrification\" has the following content:\nA power outage in a data center is far more costly than in most manufacturing facilities.

For example, the mobile substation is useful when maintenance work is needed on substations. This keeps the consumer's power from being shut off during repairs. Their compact size also makes the units easier to use in small areas. Their flexibility allows them to be switched from one task to another relatively easily. \nStandard ⚫ Optional ⚪ Not Applicable 🚫\n  \nMobile Transformers are fast-recovery, multi-voltage units that are available with Hitachi Energy’s “shell-type” technology that uses a patented unique configuration of the transformer’s active components. It enables an ultra-compact and durable solution ideal for emergencies and quick transport. \nThese power transformers are often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Mobile Transformers are factory-built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil-filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours and can be detached from their moving base for extended or specific operations. \nMobile Transformers can cover a broad range of emergency response scenarios. When installed on a trailer, the transformer can be shipped to different locations within 230kV and 345kV. \nMobile Transformer 2 design options:\nSame physics and functionality but different construction. \nThese transformers are part of a mobile substation, including switchgear, breakers, control, and protection circuits. This mobile power station can be on location within 24 hours and provide temporary electrical power to the downed area. The units are designed for outdoor use, some having a long-life, durable coating. Their most significant advantage is the ability to move from one location to another quickly. \nSimilar to our Mobile Transformer products, a Mobile Shunt Reactor is often mounted on a leak-proof base and can be installed and operated in a semi-trailer, box truck, or sea freight container. Since a shunt reactor is an absorber of reactive power, it will increase the energy efficiency of the system by also being the most compact device commonly used for reactive power compensation in long high-voltage transmission lines, which makes them ideally suited for mobile applications. \nMobile Shunt Reactors are factory built and tested and delivered completely assembled and oil filled. They can be installed on-site in a matter of hours, and they can also be detached from their moving base (semi-trailer, box truck, or sea-freight container) for operations. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"Mobile Transformers and Mobile Substation Transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/special-application-transformers/mobile-transformers-and-mobile-substation-transformers\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \" Velocity Suite | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/energy-portfolio-management/market-intelligence-services/velocity-suite\" has the following content:\nEnergy markets are moving faster than ever, and the volume of fundamental market information generated by market participants is growing exponentially.

By performing oil reclamation, where the oil is passed through an absorbent, the oil can be reinserted into the transformer in a new state. \nOil is a natural material that ages due to the operating environment and transformer properties. Through oil sampling and analysis, the condition of the oil can be inferred. Aged oil demonstrates a higher concentration of oxidation and acids.\n \nOil reclamation or oil regeneration is a process whereby oil is processed to achieve a significant condition improvement, aimed at being as close to “as new” as possible, by removing the aging products. The processing is performed while a transformer is in service to achieve maximum effectiveness with minimum impact on on-site operations. The oil affects the insulation in the transformer, and the insulation affects the oil; hence the condition of the oil impacts the expected life of the transformer.\n \nFor some transformers, there is data available for up to 10 years after reclamation. The data shows very little change in acidity and color after 10 years of operation since the oil was reclaimed.\n \nTo prevent excessive production of acids due to oil degradation, it is recommended that the oil be reclaimed before it is severely degraded. Low molecular weight acids migrate into the paper insulation and become much harder to remove than from the oil.\n \nThe essential elements of the online reclamation technology are that the absorbent is automatically reactivated after each cycle and that the transformer remains in operation. The reactivation allows for using much more active absorbent than with the classical type of reclaiming plants, where the Fullers' earth needs to be replaced frequently and thereafter disposed of. The final step is to restore the inhibitor content.\n \nThe essential elements of the online reclamation technology are that the absorbent is automatically reactivated after each cycle and that the transformer remains in operation. The reactivation allows for using much more active absorbent than with the classical type of reclaiming plants, where the Fullers' earth needs to be replaced frequently and thereafter disposed of. The complete oil volume is typically circulated 8 to 12 times over the Fullers' earth to achieve a long-lasting effect.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

The lifetime of these organic products in a transformer depends on the insulation's operating temperature, oxygen content, oil acidity, and moisture content.  \nIt is possible to reverse the aging of mineral oil through oil reclamation that can restore the material properties close to the values when new. The aging of paper insulation, however, is an irreversible process and is considered one of the life-limiting processes of a transformer. \nTemperature is mainly dependent on the transformer design, the loading, the cooling facilities, and the ambient temperature.  Cooling overhaul or upgrade is a highly recommended solution for operating the transformer at a lower temperature or for power upgrade purposes. Moreover, this alternative has significant cost savings versus new transformer replacement.  \nBushings are key components in the transformer. Thermal and electrical stress, ambient conditions, and more put high demands on bushings resulting in failures originating in the bushings, most often leading to severe consequences such as fires and explosions. Condition assessment and replacement of bushings by the latest state-of-the-art technology reduce the risk of transformer failures. \nOn the other hand, Tap-changers cause concern due to their service needs and failure probability, but with appropriate service and certified technicians, this probability can be dramatically reduced. As the OEM of transformers and tap-changers, our global team of experts and certified technicians stand ready to provide support 24/7. Always maintain the highest quality of service with original spare parts, the latest training, and the possibility of upgrading your OLTC. \nTo extend the life of your assets, Hitachi Energy provides preventive (eventually curative) actions to be performed on-site, aiming to maintain the performance of the transformer for which specific equipment and a higher degree of expertise are required. It is usually linked with diagnosis tests, engineering, and life cycle assessment to clearly determine the most appropriate route of action and ensure condition-based maintenance. \nThe page with name \"Transformer Component Upgrades | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Semiconductors | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/semiconductors\" has the following content:\nWe offer one of the most diverse power semiconductor portfolios, including GTOs, IGBTs, IGCTs, Thyristors, and Diodes in the power range of 150 A up to 13500 A and 200 V up to 8500 V.

At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way. \nThe TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.\n \nThyristor controlled series compensation principle\nThere are two main principles supporting TCSC technology. \nThe TCSC achieves both objectives by using control algorithms that work concurrently. The controls will function on the thyristor circuit (this in parallel to the main capacitor bank) such that controlled charges are added to the main capacitor, making it a variable capacitor at fundamental frequency but a \"virtual inductor\" at subsynchronous frequencies. \nThyristor controlled series compensation technology\nFrom a principal technology point of view, the TCSC resembles the conventional series capacitor. The power equipment is located on an isolated steel platform, including the thyristor valve used to control the inductor in parallel with the capacitor bank. The inductor is placed on support insulators outside the platform. Control and protection systems are located on ground potential, together with other auxiliary systems. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"Thyristor controlled series compensation | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/thyristor-controlled-series-compensation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Hitachi Energy bushings for AC transformers and reactors | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-for-ac-applications\" has the following content:\nOur bushings are an essential component of AC transformers and reactors, helping to ensure that these critical pieces of equipment operate safely and reliably over the long term. \nHitachi Energy bushings are electrical insulation components that are designed for AC transformers and reactors.

The system is designed to run 24/7 for thirty years or more, allowing the HVDC system to be controlled and protected in the most reliable way throughout its life time. \nTo fulfill current and future requirements Hitachi Energy has developed the Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) system as a fully computerized one, using state-of-the-art computers, microcontrollers and digital signal processors connected by high-performance industrial standard buses and fiber optic communication links. Because of the extensive use of computers and micro-controllers, it has been possible to include very powerful internal supervision, which eliminates periodic maintenance of the control equipment. \nThe system consists of the station control and monitoring servers, operator workstations, control and protection main computers, digital signal processor units, I/O systems and valve control units. Thanks to the modularity and high performance of the MACH equipment, the type of hardware and system software used for a VSC-HVDC  control system are the same as in an LCC-HVDC or a FACTS control system. In fact, only the application software and the valve control differs. \nThe ability to upgrade is yet another advantage with Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™). That means even an older HVDC system can enjoy the benefits of great controllability.

The level of possible contamination of the insulating oil over the years depends on its design, especially on the effectiveness of the oil preservation system and sources of contamination.\n \nBy sampling and analyzing the dielectric fluid, contaminants can be detected, and appropriate preventative actions initiated. The Oil and Gas Analysis remains a critical component of the condition assessment of the transformer. \nUsing our global reach, we support many customers worldwide in the collection of oil samples, the oil and gas analysis in our certified oil laboratories, as well as providing a first analysis of the unit's health status. Combining this with our extensive design knowledge as well as repair/refurbishment know-how accumulated over the years, we can present a more comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations to prolong the usage of the transformer. \nOnline oil regeneration has technical and economic advantages when applied to old transformers with aged, acidic oil. The process is more environmentally friendly than oil replacement and demonstrates much better efficiency over the long term. This is a very efficient alternative to passivation since it enables the definitive removal of corrosive compounds from corrosive oils, thus avoiding the risk of copper sulfide formation. \nThe page with name \"Inspection and diagnostics | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/inspection-and-diagnostics\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Traction transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/transformers/special-application-transformers/traction-transformers\" has the following content:\nTraction transformers are critical components in the traction chain, affecting train performance and operator services.

Hitachi Energy STATCOM, under the brand name of SVC Light®, is based on chain-link modular multilevel (MMC) voltage source converters (VSC), particularly adapted for power system applications. It is capable of providing high reactive power in grids more or less unimpeded by suppressed voltages, and with a high dynamic response. Further development has combined VSC technology with that of thyristor-based SVC (Static Var Compensator), combining the best of both technologies and offering joint benefits by incorporating Thyristor Switched Capacitors (TSC) and Thyristor-Switched Reactors (TSR) to create a Hybrid STATCOM solution. \nIn general, STATCOM comes into the picture where available space in substations is scarce, the reactive power output needs to be controllable more or less independent of the AC system voltage, or a speed of response is desired one order of magnitude greater than what is possible with thyristors. Also, VSC based solutions are less sensitive and dependent on network conditions. Harmonic filters in classic SVCs are a weak point, as their performance depends entirely on the harmonic impedance of the network.\n \nSTATCOM in itself provides a symmetrical operating range. For asymmetrical operation and in order to optimize performance, Hybrid STATCOM may be the best solution, in particular for very large Mvar operation ranges.  In these cases, the STATCOM power can be supplemented by thyristor switched branches to attain the desired Mvar output. TSR (Thyristor Switched Reactor) provides extension of the inductive range, whereas TSC (Thyristor Switched Capacitor) provides extension of the capacitive range of the device. By means of fast switched thyristor valves in joint operation with the VSC, TSR and TSC enable rapid, repeated and transient free switching of reactive elements (reactors and capacitors).    \nMultilevel VSC based STATCOM has low harmonic generation. As neither TSC nor TSR add any harmonics to the picture, Hybrid STATCOM has low harmonic generation, too. As a benefit, no low order harmonic filters are required in the installation. \nSTATCOM as well as Hybrid STATCOM for power transmission applications normally make use of a power transformer between the grid and the medium voltage busbar. On this bus the VSC is connected in series with a coupling reactor. In addition, in the Hybrid case, TSR and TSC are added in parallel. \nOur sales team will get in touch with you  \nThe page with name \"STATCOM - Hybrid | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/statcom/statcom-hybrid\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \" Replace & Decommission | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substation-automation--protection---control/grid-automation-services/replace-and-decommission/#contact\" has the following content:\nThere comes a time when all equipment reaches the end of its operational life.

The main attraction of going offshore is the enormous wind resource available. Average wind speeds can be 20 percent higher, and the resulting energy yield up to 70 percent greater than on land. The lack of obstacles such as hills, and the generally smooth surface of the sea, also makes the wind more reliable.\n \nWith more and larger wind parks set to be built offshore, major investments are needed to find ways to feed the power into the grid. The alternating current technology used in the first, smaller offshore wind parks is increasingly reaching its limits on account of the high reactive power demand of the cables. For wind farms distant to the coast, HVDC Light is the ideal means to bring the power to shore and to assure a good power quality. \nThe HVDC Light converter stations have a small station footprint and low weight - a fact that is of particular importance in the offshore station. \nThe on-shore (receiving) converter station can be located close to the shore or further inland. The grid is sometimes rather weak (radial structure) along the coastline, but this may not necessarily be a problem, since HVDC Light can be connected to weak points. But it is also easy to bring the connection point to a major substation at some distance from the shore by means of the HVDC Light cables. \nThe newest example of a HVDC Light wind farm transmission offshore is the 1200 MW Dogger Bank. \nDogger Bank Wind Farm will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm when completed in 2026.\n \nHitachi Energy transmission technology supports Germany’s green energy transition.\n \nThe link will help avoid more than three million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. \nA new world record with VSC at ±320 kV \nYour exclusive copy of The Economist's Technology Quarterly \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"Offshore wind connections | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc/offshore-wind-connections\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Engineering and consulting | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/engineering-and-consulting\" has the following content:\nIn a fast-changing environment, asset managers need to keep up with past challenges to produce, transmit, distribute, and deliver electrical power in a reliable way. Aging assets, rising energy demand, and the need to deliver without unplanned outages are some of the challenges utilities and industries are facing today around the world. \nFixing these challenges means that new solutions are needed to maintain the installed base of assets as well as when refurbishing, repairing, or upgrading legacy transformers. Since the late 90s, Hitachi Energy has offered a modular three-step approach to a Condition-Based Maintenance or Reliability Centered Maintenance program:\n \nStep 1. Fleet screening survey: A quick scan of a large population (20 to 200 units) collects easily accessible data, such as unit nameplate data, oil and dissolved-gas-in-oil data, load profile, history of the unit, and sister units.\n \nStep 2. Condition assessment: At this stage, transformer design experts focus on a smaller number of units (10 to 20) identified in step 1. They use modern design rules and tools to evaluate the original design. Advanced diagnostic tests are performed to assess each of the principal properties of the transformer in a structured way. This assessment leads to an estimate of each transformer`s risk of failure and defines action plans to improve the reliability of each unit. \nStep 3. Expertise: The number of units to be further analyzed is typically limited to two or three out of a population of 100 units. This third module of the assessment process provides accurate information with respect to overloading transformers, enhancing their performance (power or voltage increase), or extending their lifetime. \nOur service offerings assess the operational condition of transformers, provide recommendations to mitigate risks, and enhance the performance of aged equipment to meet possible new requirements. It also provides state-of-the-art information on online monitoring solutions, maintenance, and repair options to be used to ensure reliable operating conditions. \nIt is three steps approach that can be applied to a single or fleet of transformers. The steps include fleet screening, design and condition assessment, and life assessment /profiling of the transformer fleet. The reports provide each transformer's condition and life assessment with recommendations for further action in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of failures. \nFor more information on MTMP™, please download the leaflet below: \nVisual Inspection, Standard Oil Test (SOT), Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Furan Analysis, Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), Copper Sulphide (Cu2S), Standard and Special Tests \nAdvanced Dissolved Gas Analysis (ADGA), Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), On-Load Tap Changer Vibration Diagnostic, Dielectric Frequency Response (DFR), Partial Discharge Analysis (PDA) \nFor more information on Advance Diagnostics Testing, please download the leaflet below: \nHigh-voltage testing, including applied and induced testing with Partial Discharge measurement on-site. \nFor more information on TrafoSiteTesting™, please see the links below: \nOur bushing diagnostics package includes required inspection and testing to determine the condition of your bushings accurately, providing early warning of failure and enabling proactive replacement planning.

Because of the high electrical stress levels in bushings, failures in oil-impregnated bushings with porcelain insulators tend to result in sudden and catastrophic failure of an explosive nature. \nCondition assessment and replacement of defect bushings, therefore, drastically reduce the risk of transformer failures. Certain types and applications may have a higher risk which is yet another reason for condition assessment. Knowing the health of your bushings allows you to take planned precautionary actions in time, be it in maintenance or replacement – all with the purpose of keeping your transformer reliable and online, supporting your network. \nLittle maintenance is required other than checking the oil level (if applicable), power factor and capacitance testing, and checking the condition of the top terminals. Bushings exposed to salt spray, concrete dust, and other abnormal deposits are subject to a special hazard and must be cleaned regularly to prevent flashover and corrosion of parts. \nOil-filled bushings may be considered for exchange to dry-type with composite insulators to reduce the consequences of failures and the need for maintenance. Repair of high-voltage condenser bushings is normally not economically justifiable. However, exceptions exist. \nHitachi Energy's offering includes installation, preventive maintenance, condition assessment as well as replacement or upgrades.\n \nThe page with name \"Bushing Replacements | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/component-upgrade/bushing-replacements\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"TOE OIP Transformer Bushings | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection/ac-bushing-type-toe-550-kv-4000-a\" has the following content:\nThe Hitachi Energy TOE bushing is a 550 kV oil-impregnated transformer bushing for oil-air application with a maximum rated current of ≤ 4000 A in accordance with GB/T 4109 Standard. \nTOE Bushings \nOur team is available 24/7. \nCheck out delivery states and details. \nVisit our web-based product selector application tool for bushings and on-load tap-changers catalog that aims to increase product knowledge, facilitate selection, and know the correct product use to fit your requirements. \nFind a specific product by filtering various parameters \nThe page with name \"TOE OIP Transformer Bushings | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection/ac-bushing-type-toe-550-kv-4000-a\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Japan Energy Market Intelligence  | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/energy-portfolio-management/market-intelligence-services/japan-energy-market-intelligence\" has the following content:\nThis offering provides subscribers a SaaS tool with all historical market information updated multiple times per day. It also provides subscribers one release of Hitachi Energy’s Japan Reference Case forecast with expansion plans, fuel price forecasts, prices forecasts and commentary for market changes and assumptions.\n \nThe product is developed by the Hitachi Energy’s Velocity Suite team, the industry’s most trusted source for data in North America.

There are several back-to-back stations in operation in the world. In these installations both the rectifier and the inverter are located in the same station and are normally used in order to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks, which could have the same or different frequencies. Another benefit is using a back-to-back for splitting up a too strong network to reduce short circuit current.  \nThe direct voltage level can be selected without consideration of the optimum values for an overhead line and a cable and is therefore normally quite low, 150 kilovolts (kV) or lower.

To interface with existing equipment, we offer standalone merging units and breaker intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) (SAM600 I/O system). \nIn general, digital technology will reduce testing in the future, as all systems will become supervised and will allow you to shift from fixed, time-based to condition- or risk-based maintenance schemes. Specifically testing the digital substation provides a safer testing behavior that reduces the effort for disconnection voltage and current circuits. \nThe digital substation has different entry points, making it easy for you to get started with the application and amount of technology that best fit your organization’s current needs and level of maturity. For example, you can begin with monitoring or communications to test how it benefits you in the short term. Once you’ve undertaken this step, the next step could be to translate this learning to the network or enterprise level. In short, you do not necessarily have to begin with an entire digital substation and instead can start with a test concept. Hitachi Energy has a long history of successfully delivering digital substation projects, having worked on more than 50 digital substations, and we are perfectly positioned to guide you through the project based on your pace and specific organizational needs. \nDigital technology improves safety because there are fewer signal connections or inadvertently opened CT circuits that could harm personnel during commissioning and service activities.  \nDigital substations reduce your carbon footprint because they require less space for protection and control panels. Also, functions that were previously executed by physically separate equipment can be integrated into one device.\n\n \nAchieve higher productivity with new asset management systems that include monitoring and diagnostics data from substation equipment. This added insight substantially improves the efficiency of service activities. Monitoring and diagnostics are strategic features for utilities, further reducing outage time and increasing reliability.\n\n \nTake the lead in the digitalization of your grid, ensure longer lifecycle of your assets, and ensure a more secure communication environment with IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 Hitachi Energy certified products and tools.  Hitachi Energy’s SAM600 and PCM600 are designed and certified to comply to the latest IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 standard, enabling interoperability and reliable communication between digital assets even in complex systems. \nSince its publication in 2004, the global IEC 61850 standard has been accepted at a remarkably fast rate. Developed with the support of Hitachi Energy, it is the first truly global standard in the electric utility field.\n\nThe evolution hasn't stopped there. Since the advent of the IEC 61850 edition 2 in 2011, which takes the standard outside of the substation, Hitachi Energy invested tremendous efforts in implementing this standard in our systems, tools, and products. We believe IEC 61850 is the basis for a successful and modern digital grid. \nThe defining feature of a digital substation is the implementation of a process bus. The introduction of IEC 61850 in 2005 was a key enabler for digitization and digitalization of power systems everywhere. The various technological advances spurred by IEC 61850 raised customer expectations about the quality and reliability of power supply. The IEC 61850 process bus enables the substitution of point-to-point copper connections between IEDs and other devices (e.g., instruments transformers, gas monitoring, etc.) with a safe and standardized optical communication bus.  \nHitachi Energy has a longstanding experience in digital substations, placing it at the market forefront of this technology innovation, ensuring compliance with the highest standards in the industry.\n \nRetrofitting is a vital and natural next step to extend the service life of your substation, helping to lower capital expenditure and increase network reliability. \nRetrofit scenarios are pivotal for substations, as the lifecycle of secondary equipment is typically half that of primary devices. \nHowever, retrofit projects are, by their nature, more challenging than new projects. This is because of compatibility challenges between the old and new devices, which, in turn, could cause operational disruptions during commissioning. \nThere are many directions you can take to install or upgrade a substation, depending on needs and budget. Therefore, it is important to choose a strategic partner who is an expert in the field to ensure the smooth installation and functioning of your new or retrofitted substations. \nThe page with name \"Digital Substations | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substation-automation-protection-and-control/substation-automation-systems/digital-substation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Indoor substations | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/smart-grid-and-urban-substations/indoor-substations\" has the following content:\nHitachi Energy innovative technologies can shrink the size of an electrical substation by up to 70 percent and greatly minimize noise emissions.

An SVC will typically regulate and control the voltage to the required set point under normal steady state and contingency conditions and thereby provide dynamic, fast response reactive power following system contingencies (e.g. network short circuits, line and generator disconnections). In addition, an SVC can also increase transfer capability, reduce losses, mitigate active power oscillations and prevent over voltages at loss of load. \nThe Static Var Compensators (SVCs) is customized to fit each customer with their specific needs. The SVC consists of a number of fixed or switched branches, of which at least one branch includes thyristors, and the combination of branches can be varied a lot depending on requirements. An SVC typically includes a combination of at least two of the given items below (e.g. TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC): \nMost common topologies for Static Var Compensators are: TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC. The main advantage for using a topology with TSC branch(es) is to reduce the losses (by reducing the filter size). Hitachi Energy's SVC control system can be utilized for controlling new or existing external shunt banks. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"Static Var compensation (SVC) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/static-var-compensation-svc\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Shore-to-ship power and Smart Ports | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/shore-to-ship-power-and-smart-ports\" has the following content:\nTo minimize the environmental impact of ports in the light of increasing goods and passenger traffic as well as ever more stringent emissions regulations, ship and port owners and operators are seeking ways to improve energy efficiency, productivity and sustainability of port operations.

Transformers containing this technology can literally expand, absorbing energy from faults.\n \nHitachi Energy has developed the TXpand™ technology through careful analysis and modeling to make the most rigid areas flexible, the weakest points stronger, and integrating rupture points to take control of the most unpredictable failures. \nThe TXpand™ solution has been demonstrated as capable of absorbing the expansion caused by a simulated 20 megajoule fault. Containing the energy safely, reducing risk and increasing safety for people in and around power substations. \nThe features of TXpand™ design mitigate the consequences of even catastrophic failures. \nIn tests simulating a very large and impossible contain, 66 megajoule fault the TXpand™ demonstrated that the rupture can be controlled; minimizing any oil spilled and predictably channeling what little oil escapes for more easy containment. \nMore control and easier containment not only protect people in the area but also protect other valuable assets in a substation. \nBy preventing damage to other substation equipment, the risk of power failure is reduced, and maintenance or replacement of this equipment is minimized. \nOur sales team will get in touch with you \nThe page with name \"TXpand™ | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/power-transformers/txpand\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)  | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/modular-switchgear-monitoring-msm\" has the following content:\nModular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) is used to supervise, manage and analyze performance of all type of high-voltage switchgear in new installations as well as a retrofit solution in existing high-voltage assets. The system operates independently of existing control and protection devices and can be installed in new substations or retrofitted in existing installations. By continuously monitoring critical parameters, MSM provides the base layer for a predictive maintenance strategy for the installation.The system is compliant with IEC 61850 and DNP 3.0 and it is provided with a web interface where all monitored data are accessible. \nApplications\n \nBased on the monitoring application, MSM is offered in 2 versions with additional options: \nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n   \nSF6 moisture \nHighly stable SF6 and gas density sensors are used to continuously monitor the integrity of the gas compartments and identify gas losses at an early stage. Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications: \nMSM gas monitoring feature is compatible with EconiQTM portfolio and other gas mixtures. \nNon-invasive hall sensors and signals from auxiliary switches are used to monitor key parameters of the circuit breaker. Measured signals include phase current during operation, trip and close coil current, and motor current. Monitored parameters are categorized in mechanical performance, wear, as well as accessories. Measured curves are stored as comtrade files on the system, allowing further analysis. \n\nAll features of MSM-I are included in this application as well.\n\nBenefits of MSM-II for circuit-breaker applications:\n \nHumidity Monitoring \nHigh levels of humidity in SF6 impact its dielectric withstand (the condensation of water on the surface of insulators will lead to significant reduction of dielectric strength and flashover) and on the formation of corrosive and toxic decomposition products. It is important to control humidity during initial manufacture, assemble, commissioning and over the lifetime of the equipment. \nContinuous humidity monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. \nCorrect heater operation in drives, cubicles, etc. is crucial for reliable operation of circuit breakers. \nMonitoring of heaters is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II\n \n\nDisconnector and earthing switch monitoring\n \nDisconnector and earthing switches are critical live components of high-voltage switchgears. Disconnector monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II \n\nInternal arc localization\n \nDetect an internal fault arc and localize the gas compartment where it occurs is important since the event has a possible impact on gas dielectric withstand. \nMSM allows to reduce the effort to determine the fault location by gas pressure analysis, automatically identifying the gas compartment where an arc occurs.  \nInternal arc localization is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. \n\nTravel curve monitoring with measured travel curve\n \nMechanical performance of switchgear depends on the travel characteristic of the closing and open operations. \nMSM-II can simulate travel curve but if accurate travel curve measure is needed, the travel curve monitoring with measured travel curve option can be installed. \nMSM provides:\n\n \nOur sales team will get in touch with you  \nThe page with name \"Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)  | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/modular-switchgear-monitoring-msm\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"EconiQ™ Live Tank Circuit Breaker – LTA | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/air-insulated-switchgear/econiq-live-tank-breaker-lta\" has the following content:\n\nThe EconiQ LTA breaker uses the same technology as the well-proven Hitachi Energy's SF6 Live Tank Circuit Breaker product range.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

It also feeds auxiliary converters for other electrical systems like lighting, heating, and/or onboard information systems.  \nIf the traction transformer fails, the planned train traffic schedule may be disturbed and leads to passenger inconvenience, and even costly penalties may be incurred. \nA traction transformer is highly reliable and designed to perform under harsh conditions. However, to prevent unpredicted failure and ensure a long lifetime, some services are advised during the whole life cycle. \nThe operating conditions of a traction transformer differ highly from power transformers. Therefore the interpretation of condition checks has to be done by traction experts; otherwise, misleading results may occur. \nRegular oil analysis gives a good image of the actual health. Additionally, basic and advanced diagnostic tests can provide further information. \nIf an onboard traction transformer gets damaged by an accident or due to other reasons, we are able to fully repair the traction transformer by replacing damaged parts of the core, winding reclamping, partial or full winding replacement, and repair of the tank. At the end of such work, all electrical routine tests are done. \nDuring the long lifetime of a vehicle, some operational conditions change. Upgrading or replacing some parts of the traction transformer can help ensure further operation. \nA midlife overhaul is recommended to ensure reliability in the second half of the lifetime. All traction transformers are systematically checked and maintained by replacing parts with lower lifetime expectancy. \nThe page with name \"Workshop Repairs for Traction Transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend/workshop-repairs-for-traction-transformers\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"\n            \n          LinkedIn Login, Sign in | LinkedIn\n      \n        \" and URL \"http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/grid-expand&mini=true\" has the following content:\nLinkedIn and 3rd parties use essential and non-essential cookies to provide, secure, analyze and improve our Services, and to show you relevant ads (including professional and job ads) on and off LinkedIn.

Temperature and vacuum are the main factors for drying speed and drying quality. \nFor optimized drying, the transformer should be heated at the same time as the vacuum is applied (as is done during the vapor phase process). With the combination of the low-frequency heating (LFH) technique and hot oil spray or hot oil circulation, this can also be achieved on-site.\n \nThe low-frequency voltage is necessary in order to reduce the applied voltage on the transformer when it is under vacuum. The reason is that the breakdown voltage of the insulation system is much lower under vacuum than under atmospheric pressure. This is also known as Paschen's law.\n \nIn order to prevent hotspots during drying (due to reduced cooling), the applied current for heating power transformers should not exceed 50% of the nominal current. Consequently, the copper losses will be no more than Ľ of the nominal losses, and the risk of potential hot spots at points with higher resistance will be negligible. \nIn order to heat up both the low and high-voltage windings, a frequency of approximately 1 Hz is applied to the transformer.\n \nThe transformer can be heated uniformly with the combination of LFH drying and the conventional hot oil spray method. The LFH system heats the windings from the inside, and the hot oil spray supports the heating process by heating the outer parts of the insulation system. \nThe page with name \"On-site low frequency heating (LFH) drying | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/parts-and-maintain/advanced-maintenance/on-site-low-frequency-heating-lfh-drying\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Pole-mounted distribution transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/distribution-transformers/liquid-filled-distribution-transformers/small-distribution-transformers-up-to-315-kva/pole-mounted-distribution-transformers\" has the following content:\nHitachi Energy's pole-mounted distribution transformers are mounted above ground on poles.

IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time. \nAn HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks. \nCables and small converter stations - HVDC has great potential for city applications. \nHVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day. \nAvoid using expensive fuel in small uneconomic plants - make an HVDC connection to a larger grid. \nDC technology provides a more secure and optimized control of a network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout. \nBeing proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown. \nIn many regions of the world, liberalized energy markets have introduced the phenomenon of trading to electricity sectors and trading is enabled by coupling electricity markets with network interconnections. \nHitachi Energy's technology for the offshore wind power industry is essential in the transmission of high quality power with minimal loss. \nMany classical HVDC systems use overhead transmission lines. In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations. \nHVDC Light® can be used to deliver power both to and from offshore platforms. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \nThe page with name \"High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Rail and Road Communications | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/communication-networks/rail-communications\" has the following content:\nFrom high-speed trains that improve intercity connections to light rail, metro systems, trams, and eBus networks that alleviate congestion, reduce emissions, and improve quality of life, the world is moving toward a new era of mobility. \nThese days most offices grind to a halt in the face of a failed internet connection, but this isn't comparable to the failure of the telecommunication system that underpins regular and resilient transportation operations. \nThe digitalization of the industry relies on a robust, reliable, and predictable communication network, which is sometimes called the third utility, water, and power is the first and second. It is also foundational to Industry 4.0. Only industrial suppliers with an intimate knowledge of the transportation industry can supply, and maintain, communications equipment capable of meeting that unique set of demands including the system life cycle requirements of a rail asset. \nHitachi Energy’s wired and wireless communications portfolio offers long-lasting support for transportation specific OT applications, while also delivering on the requirements of digital railways and urban transport networks of the future. \nDeployed in the Arabian Desert and Siberia, our mission-critical communications equipment for transportation providers are also exposed to strong EMF (electromagnetic fields) coming from the electrical traction supply system. Furthermore, the environment may be dusty or located in tunnels with challenging access for preventive maintenance, therefore fans may not be desirable. In order to maintain the high levels of availability required, especially in emergency situations, mission-critical communications equipment must offer a robust and reliable design that has proven capabilities for providing accurate functionality under extreme conditions. \nUrban rail transport safety, reliability, and efficiency critically rely on communication systems to face growing challenges, including dense traffic and complexity of networks, automation, and integration with other networks. \nMost large and even small cities around the world are building or expanding their urban Rail (metros and suburban), as part of large-scale environment-friendly mass mobility transformation. Hitachi Energy Mission-critical communication systems is helping municipalities and cities around the globe in this environmentally responsible smart city transformation. \nHitachi Energy mission-critical communications solutions for rail and urban transportation connect your asset-based operations and ensure a high-resolution perspective of your networks and operations for revolutionary efficiencies\n \nRailway signaling (ETCS and other)\nThe European Train Control System (ETCS) is the signaling and control component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). It is a replacement for legacy train protection systems and designed to replace the many incompatible safety systems currently used by European railways. The standard is also adopted outside Europe and is an option for worldwide applications. \nGSM-R\nGSM-R, Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway is an international wireless communications standard for railway communication and applications. A sub-system of ERTMS, it is used for communication between train and railway regulation control centers. \nRailway operational telephony\nIn order to operate, Railways use fixed telephony with many different types of users. The station master will need one or more lines to manage the operation of the station. The power dispatcher (controlling the high voltage power on the line) needs to be able to talk with the substations. Most railways also have trackside telephones that are used by track workers or train drivers in case of emergency. There will also be telephone services offered to the general public, e.g. an emergency phone on a station platform or in a tunnel. \nCustomer service applications\nWith the pressing need for railways to be ever more customer-centric, ticketing systems, various visual and audio customer information systems, as well as Internet access for passengers in stations, are very important and visible services that the network needs to deliver. \nSCADA data for traction power\nSCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) monitor and control the Traction Power distribution, with a number of Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and/or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) trackside and operator terminals at the Control Center. SCADA Systems achieve protection and automation of power supply, acquisition, and storage of parameters of power supply, monitoring and controlling the entire power supply system, alarm and logging system, load management, load shedding, power quality monitoring, and management. There is also a separate SCADA system to control station automation. \nCCTV, access and perimeter control\nAcross rail networks, security has become a more pressing issue. The trend is towards a digital infrastructure for physical security applications, allowing us to take one camera and view it in one or 100 positions without affecting the quality of the video stream. This allows railways to distribute the management of control operational centers and create buddy systems, back-up control rooms and extra viewing positions by using digital network infrastructure. This also paves the way for video analytics. In the past, there would have been numerous separate access control, video surveillance, and intercom systems, but now they tend to be managed as single security systems through the use of hypervisors. \nWireless connectivity for rail staff and asset monitoring\nWireless connectivity in stations and train yards makes business support systems always available and optimize staff workload. With the digitalization of more and more systems, reliable connectivity is a crucial enabler for an efficient asset management policy. Hitachi Energy Wireless solutions provide that extra connectivity layer.  \nHitachi Energy is enabling industrial-strength mission-critical communications network solutions, building reliable, secure, manageable, and scalable foundations that provide performance for Intelligent Transport Systems. \nIntelligent Transport Systems are entirely reliant on good communications; to know where vehicles comprising the network are, but also to monitor the equipment keeping the network moving. If you add the digitalization of much more equipment it can generate huge quantities of data at a high velocity, which must be transported over a robust communications network. That network needs punctuality when the situation demands it, and redundancy to maintain connectivity in the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is an umbrella term for a wide range of solutions that provide benefits to mass transit systems including buses. ITS applications for mass transit include transit signal priority, automated vehicle location, computer-aided dispatch, telemetry as well as passengers’ infotainment. \nMission-critical networks are foundational, enabling ITS applications by providing two-way communication between sensors, controllers and people in the field, and software and supervisory personnel in the operations center. Communication technologies also facilitate interaction among drivers, dispatchers, emergency responders, and other personnel involved in transit and transportation operations. Those networks cover the following characteristics: \nHitachi Energy enabling mission-critical communications network solutions are industrial strength and can be used to build a highly reliable, secure, manageable, and scalable foundation that meets the performance and capacity required for ITS communications systems.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store.
