    "SIEMENS": "The page with name \"Power generation and distribution\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/power-generation-and-distribution.html\" has the following content:\nNearly all onboard processes require electrical power and a reliable power distribution system. With electrical power generation and distribution solutions for vessels, Siemens Energy ensures that power can be generated, distributed, and used exactly where it is needed. This guarantees the functionality, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of vessels of all sizes and types. \nOur customized, intelligent electrical power distribution solutions for vessels of all kinds are designed for maximum performance, reliability, and scalability – in conjunction with the vessel’s automation and propulsion system, if desired. We supply you with leading technological concepts, technical components, and services, from the power plant through power distribution to all consumer devices to the energy management system. All this comes from a single source, based on standardized components that are used in marine electrical systems on commercial ships worldwide and are quickly available anywhere. \nPower LV is an integrated, modular, and scalable system for providing a reliable and economical onboard power supply in low-voltage technology. \nPower MV is our solution for the onboard medium-voltage supply. It comprises all central components in medium-voltage technology.  \nSISHIP Boost with WHRS is a waste-heat recovery system for vessels that helps reduce your energy costs by up to 12 percent. \nWith SISHIP BlueDrive Eco, the SISHIP BlueDrive family is now offering scalable solutions for all drive requirements, covering diverse performance graduations for small to medium-sized drives, from 5 KW in auxiliary mode up to 5.5 MW in main drives. \nThe PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be significantly extended, which minimizes the risk of detection. \nThe operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system.  \nThere is hardly a process on board that will function without electrical power. Power LV ensures the efficient generation, distribution, and management of this power. With its integral protective mechanisms, the system achieves the highest level of supply security and functionality. \nPower LV is an integrated, modular, and scalable system for providing a reliable and economical onboard power supply in low-voltage technology. It comprises brushless synchronous generators to support all extremes of power demand, switchgear specially developed for marine use, and a power management system. In addition, various transformers and frequency converters come online to support system demands. The vessel’s generator, switchgear, transformers, and converters for the low-voltage supply can be freely combined as required, with the energy management system ensuring optimized interactions. \nThanks to integrated protection mechanisms (for example, short-circuit protection, electromagnetic compatibility, shock resistance, and automatic blackout start-up function), the low-voltage system achieves outstanding reliability with optimal efficiency, while minimizing fuel consumption by the vessel’s generator. \nYour advantages with Power LV \nVessels such as frigates or cruise ships not only have extremely high energy requirements but also place heavy demands on the operating security and fail-safe performance of the onboard electricity supply. Our Power MV system fulfills these requirements with low capital costs. \nPower MV is our solution for the onboard medium-voltage supply. Power MV comprises all central components in medium-voltage technology, including the vessel’s generator, transformers, and switchgear, and is based on reliable, standardized components. \nTo ensure the maximum availability and safety of the power supply from the vessel’s generator at all times, Power MV is equipped with mechanical protection devices for every required safety level. The medium-voltage system – consisting of the vessel’s generator, switchgear, and energy management system – is designed redundantly to guarantee the reliable, optimized generation and distribution of medium-voltage power on board. The onboard low-voltage system is supplied via transformers. \nYour advantages with Power MV \nFuel consumption is one of the largest cost items in ship operation. Remaining competitive over the long term will require highly efficient drive solutions and intelligent energy management. At the same time, environmentally friendly technologies are called for to comply with ever-stricter environmental protection regulations. The waste-heat recovery system WHRS is the best way to meet both requirements. \nSISHIP Boost with WHRS is a waste-heat recovery system for vessels that helps reduce your energy costs by up to 12 percent. The waste-heat recovery system utilizes the heat from exhaust gases to generate steam and produce additional electrical power. It not only cuts your energy costs, but also reduces the CO2 and NOx emissions of your vessel. Additionally, you gain more flexibility in vessel design. Smaller fuel tanks permit a more creative use of space and line, and the ship’s main drive can get by with a lower-rated output. Dependable, internationally available, standard components and our well-established spare parts logistics facilitate maintenance and provide you with maximum reliability. \nAll the functionalities of the WHRS are controlled using an energy management system that ensures optimal use of the available energy and automatically adapts shaft generator operation to current requirements. That means you are able to access additional power reserves, reduce wear and tear on the main engine, and increase the reliability of the onboard power supply. \nYour advantages with WHRS \nSiemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens. \nWith the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system. \nYour advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC \nThe synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent. \nThe SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control, and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC. \nSISHIP BlueDrive Eco combines the experience from both systems SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC and SISHIP EcoProp. SISHIP EcoProp is well known as a flexible, compact, high-power diesel-electric propulsion system for smaller vessels such as yachts, ferries, and public authority vessels. Like the complete SISHIP BlueDrive Family, SISHIP BlueDrive Eco uses the Siemens Energy industrial converter platform components, providing very high reliability and availability. It enables scalable systems from 5 kW inverter power use and closes the power range (to BlueDrive PlusC up to 5.5 MW inverter power), all in the same topology. \nThe advanced lithium-ion battery-based solution BlueVault for offshore installations and marine vessels is suited for both all-electric and hybrid energy-storage applications. BlueVault energy storage solutions are designed to help ensure continuity of power and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions. \nThe battery is designed to maximize life, performance, and safety. It is equipped with an integrated battery management system and overload/short circuit protection. The storage modules with 6.6 kWh Li-Ion batteries can be slid into a rack. The battery storage cubicle consists of 9 modules and 60 kWh. The cubicles can be easily lined up to the total required battery capacity. \nA fundamental requirement of submarines is to run silently and remain submerged in certain situations. Conventional diesel-electric drive models need to periodically surface to recharge their batteries, making the boat vulnerable. Our PEM fuel cells deliver an atmospheric air-independent, noiseless propulsion solution for power generation on board that can extend the dive time by several weeks. \nThe PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be extended to weeks, if required, which significantly minimizes the risk of being detected. That’s because the PEM fuel cell modules use oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity, so the potential dive time is restricted only by the supply of stored media and the boat’s energy demand. The system works without atmospheric air and is completely exhaust-free. \nAnother important advantage is that the PEM fuel cell has an ultimately low signature in operation: This helps reducing the aggregate acoustic signature of the submarine. The system’s noise signature lies well under all threshold values. With their electrochemical properties, the fuel cells themselves operate noiselessly. Even the ancillary units are optimized for low noise or can be easily incorporated into noise encapsulation thanks to their compact design. \nYour advantages with PEM fuel cells \nThe operational readiness of a modern submarine is critically dependent on the reliability and efficiency of its power supply, and that includes its DC switchgear system. Our SG-DC supply and switching system delivers a reliable power supply to the propulsion system and the various onboard networks. \nTo secure the optimum power supply for your boat in any situation, SG-DC ensures the supply, distribution, and monitoring of electrical energy for the propulsion system and all onboard networks. It is the ideal equipment for meeting the specific requirements of submarines with respect to shock and vibration resistance, electromagnetic shielding and acoustics, and external influences such as temperature, air humidity, and air pressure. \nSG-DC incorporates the main control panel for connecting the energy producers to the propulsion system, and also the auxiliary power distribution for the individual consumers and all onboard networks. The system is tailored to the individual requirements of every boat and its key characteristics are superb reliability, compact build, and low maintenance. \nYour advantages with DC switchgear \nIf you want to learn more about our offering for the marine sectors, don’t hesitate to contact us.

The three inspection scopes offered are Visual, Siemens Multifrequency Core Assessment System (SMCAS™️) and Wedge Tightness. The visual inspection utilizes on board camera(s) that are capable of digitally recording video and still images used to look for visual signs of overheating, excessive relative motion, ventilation blockages in stator or rotor vent paths and possible foreign objects. SMCAS™️ is a test that evaluates core laminations for circulating currents the same as EL CID. A feature that SMCAS™️ offers is the ability to digitally overlay previously recorded SMCAS™️results to compare for trending over the life cycle of the stator core. Wedge Tightness testing is used to assess the loading force of generator stator wedges and is a helpful tool to predict a possible outage of sufficient length when loose or loosening stator wedges need to be replaced. \nWith 3 decades of field use comes significant innovation. Siemens Energy at the Pittsburgh Service Center has begun to incorporate additive manufacturing to the latest design updates that allow for more rapid customization of inspection components that can be attached to the modular base of the FAST Gen tooling or even complete standalone solutions. This enables the Pittsburgh Service Center to help meet an ever-increasing demand of non-OEM inspection requests where generator access may offer unique obstacles. \nLoop Testing is performed to identify and restore insulation between core laminations, (if interlaminar insulation has broken down). \nHigh Frequency Flux Test \nModal analysis determines the natural frequencies and mode shapes of turbine-generator static structures across the relevant frequency ranges of operation. Testing ensures that during operation the structure is tuned away from resonant conditions that increases structure fatigue and chance of failure. Modal analysis can be performed in the field or the factory. \nModal analysis applications include: \nFurther comprehensive Siemens Generator Service Capabilities can be offered upon request. \nIf you have any questions or would like to find out how we can help you to modernize your generator equipment, please let us know. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Generator Service Capabilities\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/generator-service-capabilities.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Dead tank circuit breakers\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/dead-tank.html\" has the following content:\nWith Zero F-gases and Zero harm, this 72.5 - 145 kV circuit breaker makes a greener grid achievable \nWith the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. That’s why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid. \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 dead tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues. \nBy Frank Jossi \nIn line with shared commitments to decarbonize, National Grid and Siemens Energy are teaming up to undertake a cutting-edge upgrade of a National Grid substation using Siemens Energy designed fluorinated gas free “Blue circuit breakers” with clean air insulation and vacuum switching technology. \nWhile we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.  \nOur dead tank breaker family is available for applications from 72.5 kV up to 550 kV and for short-circuit interruption up to 90 kA. DT breakers up to 362 kV are equipped with one interrupter unit per pole, up to 550 kV with two interrupter units.  \nWe provide dead tank circuit breakers with 2-cycle operation for applications up to 362 kV. The circuit breakers can be equipped with optional closing resistors or applications from 362 kV to 550 kV. Several current transformer solutions are at your disposal which can be realized according to your specific project requirements. \nOur high-voltage dead tank circuit breakers are available for three-pole operation with a common base, for single-pole operation also with a common base or for single-pole operation with separate bases. \nYou can find details on our dead tank circuit breakers and information about our services here. \nSiemens Energy fairs, events & webinars \nWhitepapers & Recordings  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Dead tank circuit breakers\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/dead-tank.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Gas Engine Solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/gas-engine-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nEnhancing the performance of your gas engine, regardless of its OEM, is not just a service, it's a commitment to excellence.

As a first step, this can be achieved by making fuel usage more efficient. Later, this fossil fuel can be replaced with carbon-free fuel. Alternatively, heat production can also be electrified by using power from renewable energy. Existing heat networks can be transformed fast and at a large scale into cost-effective and flexible low-carbon energy systems. \nThere are several applications that can help you to decarbonize heat networks. At Siemens Energy, we provide tailor-made CHP and Power to Heat (P2H) solutions for residential, commercial, or industrial sectors. \nCHP generates electricity and heat from a single fuel source. Traditional heating plants emit varying amounts of CO2 depending on the fuel used. Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%. Additionally, converting the plant into a GT-powered CHP or a Combined Cycle Power Plant with heat extraction can significantly improve its electrical efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency can be as high as 90% while using as little fuel as possible. \nFind out which gas turbine fits best for your application. \nPower-to-heat (P2H) can be accomplished through heat pumps or electric boilers. Heat pumps utilize waste or environmental heat, raising its temperature with electricity. They produce the same heat using less electricity than electric boilers, leading to lower operational costs. Electric boilers require minimal capital investment and have quick installation. Induction-based technologies or innovative turboheaters are suitable for industrial processes requiring high temperatures. \nExplore our industrial-scale heat pump portfolio \nClean fuels, such as green hydrogen or biofuels, can drastically lower CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for fossil fuels in gas turbines. This is an effective way to future proof a combined cycle power plant and maximize its life cycle. Find out how much carbon footprint you can reduce by burning green hydrogen in your gas turbine. Calculate your carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and cost-savings potential on carbon certificates. \nCalculate your CO₂ emission reduction potential \nAnother decarbonization path is to transform fossil-fired heat generation by switching to sustainably produced biomass in Combined Heat and Power plants. When adding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), biomass- or biofuel-based CHP plants can be further transformed into bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), thus allowing for negative emissions and energy production at the same time.   \nLearn more about our biomass power plant solutions \nFor maximum efficiency, it often makes sense to combine different technologies. To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H). \nAs most of the factors influencing the technology choice depend on the location of the heating network, there is no one-fits-all solution. However, a pre-selection of suitable technologies can be done, based on the temperature level that is required for the specific application. The matrix below shows the temperature level that can be achieved with different technologies. \nContact us today to find the best solution for decarbonizing your heat network! \nRepurposing existing power plants or heating plants can substantially contribute to decarbonizing your assets. A heating plant can be transformed into a cogeneration plant, and a thermal power plant can be turned into a CHP plant. Alternatively, you can convert the complete thermal plant into a Power to Heat application. \nWith our Brownfield transformation approach, you can convert existing assets within a short time frame into a low-carbon facility while re-using the existing infrastructure as much as possible.\n \nPower-to-heat (P2H) systems signal a paradigm shift in the capabilities of low-carbon energy systems. Since heat pumps or electric boilers can be exclusively powered by green electricity, it allows the integration of renewable energy sources in heat energy production—an integration that is both crucial and long overdue. \nBy adjusting their heat output in response to variations in renewable energy generation, power-to-heat systems can also provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Power-to-heat systems convert surplus renewable energy into usable thermal energy for local or central heating and cooling needs.\n \nDue to their high Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat pumps provide low carbon heat. They are completely carbon neutral when powered entirely by renewable energy.  \nHeat can be stored significantly more cost effectively than electricity. The combination of P2H with CHP stabilizes the power market. Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time. At peak heat demand it is possible to operate the heat pump together with the CHP plant. \nA new heat pump to help MVV achieve its goal of decarbonizing district heating in Mannheim, Germany \nReplacement of a Holland Board of Public Works coal plant with a new CHP plant at Holland Energy Park \nBrownfield engine exchange service and modernization of a combned cycle power plant of BASF \nTwo cutting-edge gas turbine packages for a new district heating power plant with an expected fuel efficiency of 93% \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Combined heat and power\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/distributed-power/combined-heat-and-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Grid automation\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/grid-automation.html\" has the following content:\n\nExpertise in conventional and digital control & protection system, with design based on all latest standards (e.g., IEC61850) for process bus applications​.Advanced cybersecurity concept implementation.\n \nSupplying IEDs, MUs, network switches, etc. without vendor ties for your substation control and automation system.Integration of hardware and configuration according to customer requirements. \nOn site and remote project support on FAT, commissioning, maintenance and troubleshooting for systems with process bus. \nReduced use of copperLower number of cabinetsSmaller land footprint of substations\n  \nLess interaction with measuring loopsSmaller energized measurement circuitLess people on site\n  \nLess hardware that needs upgrade and remote upgradesRemote or online testingLower number of terminals \nDesign, protection concept studies, setting calculation, installation & commissioning, system parameterization & configuring, testing.Implementation of protection system with traditional as well as process bus as per IEC 61850. \nSubstation & secondary system design, hardware & software specification, IED and system configuration, installation & commissioning.Cybersecurity concept and design, configuration, implementation, integration of system and testing. \nEnd-to-end system (SCADA, EMS, ADMS, DERMS etc.) for customers.Design, concept, system selection, configuration, installation and commissioning.  \nOverall project coordination, system engineering​.System installation, on-site testing and commissioning. \nThe first substation in the world to combine digitalization and eco-efficiency ​on this scale:  \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

When the pipeline content (mix of oil and water) cools down, the temperature is approaching the ambient seawater temperature. \nThis can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius. \nTraditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits.  \nSiemens Energy offers DEH power supply systems to prevent hydrate formation during planned and unplanned process shutdown.  \nOur systems will contribute to a consistent flow of hydrocarbons despite challenging fluid characteristics and temperature conditions at the seabed. The respective modules of the systems may contain power electronic components as well as control and protection units for the topside equipment and subsea pipeline to be installed on the platform deck. \nThe systems are designed to control, compensate and balance the single-phase electrical load that the pipeline and the piggyback cable constitute. Each of the systems is customized to the power requirements and electrical properties of the specified subsea load, in both “heat-up” and “maintain heat” mode. The systems are designed to be optimally tuned at any load condition to ensure an excellent power factor, low harmonic feedback, and to have low negative sequence current - important for minimal impact to the platform power grid. \nAuxiliary systems for fiber-optic temperature monitoring of the piggyback cables are offered optionally, as well as solutions for remote connection to the modules’ control and protection system via a secure internet connection.  \nSiemens Energy has a conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit. \nOur conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit, allows subsea power distribution to multiple ETH loads, and uses components already qualified in the Subsea Power Grid program, together with field-proven topside components, in order to achieve a reliable design.  In combination with other subsea power grid units, like the subsea transformer, even higher degrees of flexibility and customization for specific project requirements can be achieved.   \nSiemens Energy also offers connectivity solutions for ETH applications using the SpecTRON 8 family.    \nLearn more about our ETH SpecTRON 8 solution - Connectors SpecTRON 8  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Pipeline Heating\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/direct-electrical-heating.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Hydrogen Decarbonization Calculator\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/hydrogen/hydrogen-decarb-calculator.html\" has the following content:\nLet Siemens Energy help you reach your decarbonization targets.

Instead of building new lines to provide sufficient transmission capacity, it’s often better to use our flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) technology to increase the transmission capacity. Both newly built transmission lines and existing systems benefit from Siemens Energy’ FSC which is part of the series compensation (SC) solutions that also help to improve the quality and stability of power transmission lines. \nInnovative series compensation technology provides higher transmission capacities for existing long-distance AC transmission lines and increased grid stability without the costs and time-requirement of building new lines. \nFor decades, fixed series capacitor (FSC) technology from Siemens Energy has improved grid stability and contributed to the optimal utilization of transmission lines. Transmission system operators around the world have already benefited from solutions that were tailored to their specific requirements. Among the main benefits of FSC are the reduction of line voltage drops, limitation of load-dependent drops, and a reduction of the transmission angle. \nIncreased maximum capacity \nFixed series capacitor expands the transmission capacity of lines by compensating the impedance of the overhead line. It’s a cost-efficient way to achieve larger transmission capacities instead of building new lines. \nIncreased grid stability \nWith fixed series compensation, it’s possible to provide system stability for bulk power transmission and long transmission lines by reducing voltage drops at the point of connection. This increases overall grid stability. \nEconomical solution \nThe fixed series capacitors are the most cost-efficient solution. Their simple, proven and robust technology supports transmission system operators by optimizing power transmission and increasing transmission capacity. Siemens Energy is proud to reiterate: All major components are sourced in-house. \nThe amount of power that can be transferred with long overhead transmission lines is limited by the impedance that can lead to voltage drops. For decades, fixed series compensation is the proven solution to maintain a minimum voltage profile and maximize utilization of transmission lines.  \nIt works by connecting a capacitor bank in series with the transmission line to partially compensate the inductive impedance of the line while also increasing the voltage at the point of connection. The capacitors are protected by metal-oxide varistors (MOV) and – in case of a fault – by tripping the FSC and closing the bypass breaker. For instant protection, a triggered spark gap bypasses capacitors and MOVs within less than 1 ms. Even gap-less solutions are possible, provided that local requirements match. Due to this complexity Siemens Energy recommends and offers individually designed solutions with fixed series capacitors. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Fixed series capacitor (FSC)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/fixed-series-capacitor.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Services\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/service-offerings.html\" has the following content:\nWe support companies and countries to reduce emissions across the energy landscape – for a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy system \nTo reach net zero we need to decarbonize energy.

The reasons for this are obvious: The sun is an inexhaustible source for power production. And it is not only a free fuel source but also a complete emissions-free source. Steam turbine generator sets convert solar energy into electricity. Instrumentation and controlls help to make optimal use of every single sun beam. We equipped more than 70 CSP plants all over the world and we are the market leader in that field. \nDubai’s new CSP plant is designed to collect heat from the sun and store it in molten salt or convert it directly into electricity via a steam generator set – an ideal solution for providing round-the-clock renewable electricity in unpredictable conditions. Noor Energy 1, the 950 MW Hybrid Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV plant, is the 4th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Plant and the largest single -site CSP and single hybrid solar power project in the world. \nSince the solar boom of the eighties in USA, solar thermal energy has been a proven technology. The most common type of plant is the parabolic trough collector, but alternative technologies are rapidly coming to the fore, such as Linear Fresnel collector plants with flat mirrors and central tower plants with slightly curved mirrors or heliostats. \nThe basic principle is the same for all three plant technologies: Mirrors concentrate the incident solar radiation onto a receiver where it is converted into heat that is used to produce steam to drive a steam turbine. Heat storage systems like molten salt tanks provide for power supply even during unfavorable weather conditions or at night. They significantly increase the number of full-load operation hours with optimal steam turbine efficiency. \nWith our broad steam turbine portfolio,we offer a range of turbines for different types of solar plants and all power outputs. The turbine technology fits all three common concentrated solar power concepts. We were the first steam turbine supplier to re-enter the CSP market in the 21st century, pioneering commercial solutions in the US and Spain. Today, we are the world market leader in steam turbines for CSP plants, and have more than 20 years of experience with steam turbines for daily cycling. \nParabolic systems use trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto an absorber tube (receiver) placed in the trough’s focal line. The troughs are designed to track the sun along one axis, predominantly north-south. The receivers contain a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic thermal oil, molten salt) which is heated by the focused sunlight. It is circulated in these tubes and pumped through heat exchangers to produce steam. \nThe parabolic trough technology is currently the best proven and most used technology, even though the live steam parameters are lower than in solar power tower plants. \nA circular array of flat heliostats (suntracking mirrors) concentrates sunlight on to a central receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium (water/steam, molten salt or air) in the receiver absorbs the thermal energy and transfers it into the steam cycle to generate superheated steam for the turbine. \nThe advantage over the parabolic trough or Fresnel collector concept is that the sunlight on the central receiver is focused to a smaller area, and the heat transfer medium does not have to be piped around the large solar field. This means that higher working fluid temperatures in the receiver (up to 1000°C) and better steam parameters are feasible, even supercritical steam is expected. \nThe number of concentrated solar power plants has increased tremendously in the past ten years. Today we see many different regimes of operations, each of which poses a different challenge to power generation equipment. The design of each steam turbine is adapted to these challenges. \nExamples for the regimes of operation for a solarthermal power plant, with a power output of 50 MW: \nAs market leader in industrial steam turbines, we command a comprehensive product portfolio for solar thermal plants, covering the full range from 1.5 MW to more than 250 MW. \nOptimized for challenging cycle \nCSP plants require steam turbines which are optimized for their complex and challenging cycle conditions. Bearing in mind that efficiency and total cost of ownership are key to any investment decision, we incorporate operational experience into extensive R&D and engineering activities to adapt the turbines to the specific requirements of the CSP technology. \nExcellent daily start-up solutions \nDay and night cycle often requires a large number of starts and fast daily startup capabilities from CSP steam turbines. When focusing on annual power production, the short start-up times of the turbines are of great benefit to the CSP plant owner. Daily cycling and temperature variations require special attention. \nReheat improves efficiency \nReheat solutions improve efficiency and reduce problems with erosion/corrosion and moisture in the LP turbine. Our steam turbines meet all customer requirements for economic installation and operation and provide excellent flexibility for all cycling conditions. The turbines are suitable for higher steam parameters and can be operated in non-reheat, single reheat and double reheat cycles. \nReliable steam turbine technology \nOur steam turbines are tailored to the customer requirements and shipped assembled for easy installation at site.

It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas. Only around 40% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from power generation which can be decarbonized via electrification. The other 60% of CO2 emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be decarbonized via sector coupling, using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition. \nDiscover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video! \nElyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors. \nWith our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition.

As a molecule (H2), it occurs only in small amounts in nature and it is mainly chemically bound, such as H2O. \nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. 90 percent of all atoms are hydrogen atoms. They add up to three quarters of the total mass in the universe. \nHydrogen converts into a liquid at minus 253 ºC. \nHydrogen has the highest energy density of all conventional fuels by mass: almost three times as high as that of gasoline or diesel. That is one of the reasons why hydrogen is used as fuel for space travel. \nH2 Higher  Heating  Value: 39.4 kWh/kg; H2 Lower Heating  Value: 33.3 kWh/kg \nBy combusting hydrogen, it delivers heat. Used in fuel cells, hydrogen is converted electrochemically  to electrical energy. \nHydrogen has been produced and used for more than 200 years. Experience shows that hydrogen can be stored, distributed and converted safely. As early as 1808, the first large-scale use of hydrogen was established for the street lighting system in London. \nHydrogen (H2) can be produced in different ways. For the moment more than 95% of the hydrogen worldwide is produced from hydrocarbons while producing and emitting harmful CO2. A more modern and ecofriendly technology for CO2 neutral production of hydrogen can be offered by electrolysis of water. \nHydrogen can be produced from hydrocarbons by steam reforming of natural gas - often referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR), coal gasification and from an electrolysis process of water (H2O). \nHydrogen can be stored in tanks as a compressed gas or as a liquid. Hydrogen can also be stored in caverns or in the natural gas grid for different applications and if the grid fulfils all technological requirements. \nThe volumetric energy density of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is approximately one third of traditional fuels. The volumetric energy density can be increased by compression or liquefaction of the hydrogen gas to store and transport a greater amount of hydrogen. \nFor hydrogen-powered vehicles, an industry standard of 300 to 700 bar has been established. Vehicles for the transport of compressed hydrogen, so called “tankers”, usually working with a maximum pressure of 200 bar. \nHydrogen can be transported as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid. Today, the two main methods for transporting hydrogen (primarily in a gaseous state) are via tanker e.g. tube trailer for road transportation and in gas pipelines (for short distance). \nHydrogen is a non-toxic clear gas. It is not poisonous, has no taste or odor. Using hydrogen as a fuel source with fuel cells does not create fumes, pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide or emit nitrogen oxides. \nIt is not inherently more dangerous than other fuel sources.  Hydrogen is flammable and must be handled with care, just like other flammable fuels. To ignite, the hydrogen must be combined with an additional oxidizing agent (air, pure oxygen, chlorine, etc.) in a specific  concentration and an ignition source (a spark). If, in a worst-case scenario, the hydrogen ignites, it burns upwards very quickly. It creates no dangerous heat radiation above the accident site, as petrol or kerosene do. \nThe facilities are designed to be permanently leak proof. Flange connections are designed especially for hydrogen and the number of detachable connections are minimized. Furthermore, in buildings a steady air exchange is ensured and the facilities are equipped with safety valves and pressure reliefs. Additionally explosion prevention zones are designated. In these zones, electrical and other equipment needs to be in accordance with 2014/34/EU (ATEX Directive). \nNo. Hydrogen can be safely handled and stored as well as transported. The industrial gas industry has done so for over a century. \nIn contrast to gasoline and natural gas, hydrogen gas has significant buoyancy in atmospheric conditions due to its low density, any leaking hydrogen gas ascends immediately and disperses, which reduces the risk of an ignition in open air. \nWater gets split into its components hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrical current. \nElectrolysis processes can be categorized as follows: alkaline electrolysis with liquid alkaline electrolytes, acidic electrolysis with a solid polymer electrolyte (as PEM) and high temperature electrolysis with a solid oxide as electrolyte. \nPEM electrolysis and alkaline electrolysis systems are available at an industrial scale. The solid oxide electrolysis technology is in an early development phase. \nPEM is the abbreviation for proton exchange membrane. This membrane is a crucial part of the electrolytic cell in a PEM-electrolyzer. The membrane separates the anode, where the oxygen is collected, and the cathode, where the hydrogen gas is generated. \nThe type of the ions which closes the electric circuit \n10 liter demineralized water is needed for 1kg of hydrogen. \nOn average 50kWh are necessary to produce 1kg of hydrogen, depending on the efficiency of the electrolyzer and operation mode. \nThe hydrogen market is divided in three sectors. Mobility, energy and industry with industry being by far the largest consumer today (~90%). In the future a redistribution towards the mobility and energy sector is expected . \nToday, hydrogen is an important industrial gas, i.e. for the refining of fuels, for the production of fertilizer and methanol, for the hydrogenation of fats, for steel production, metal processing, as well as in the production of flat glass. \nLess than 1kg of hydrogen is needed per 100km. \nPassenger car or light duty vehicle fueling takes 3 to 5 minutes. \nHydrogen enables the long-term storage of large quantities of surplus renewable energy. It is allows new ways to use green electricity, i.e. by using hydrogen as substitute for natural gas by feeding it into existing pipelines, as fuel for fuel-cell vehicles or power plants, or as feedstock for the hydrogen processing industry. It opens the possibility to connect energy generation with the industry and mobility sectors, the so called “sector coupling”. \nNo. Hydrogen will become a substantial and permanent element of a sustainable energy industry. \nIn the future, hydrogen will be produced to a greater extent using electricity from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, biogas and various fuels like solid biomass will help to produce green hydrogen in the future. \n‘Green’ hydrogen is sourced by 100% renewable energy. That means that the needed energy to produce hydrogen by electrolysis has emitted zero emissions. Hydrogen produced from fossil fuels releasing emissions such as CO2, may be referred to as ‘grey’ or ‘brown’ hydrogen. If the emitted carbon dioxide is captured, stored (carbon capture storage) and re-used, it is often called ‘blue’ hydrogen. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Green hydrogen production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/hydrogen-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Vision4SRP\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/vision4srp.html\" has the following content:\nPumper’s essential SRP monitoring technology \nThe Siemens Energy Vision4SRP monitoring technology helps O&G companies running oil production based on SRPs with no/low automation.

Our portfolio provides efficient power generation on your site, when and where you need it, thereby securing energy supply for the future. \nOur portfolio reflects the world's shift from large CO₂ intensive technologies into a diverse energy landscape consisting of smaller, decentralised power providers, consumers and prosumers, who are looking for solutions that ensure stable and cost-efficient operations with less emissions.  \nWith the establishment of climate objectives and the ongoing transition to renewable energy, the utilization of fossil fuels is expected to diminish. In the context of heat and power generation, the need for flexibility and self-reliance in fuel choices is becoming increasingly crucial. Green fuels can be one solution. \nHow can we build a flexible and sustainable energy system with gas turbines, renewable energy sources and energy storage? As power from solar and wind is volatile and doesn’t always match the energy demand, hydrogen produced from these green energy sources can be used as an energy storage solution and used as fuel in the gas turbines to balance the grid. \n... aspects of distributed power generation that you would never have thought might influence your business now or in the near future. \nFirst introduced in Singapore in 1975, such zones are nowadays located in cities worldwide. Car traffic limitations, tree planting. What else? Look at the sidewalk. Do you notice any ventilation grids? There might be a diesel backup engine of a hospital, office or data center beneath your feet. \nEven modern, diesel-fueled backup generators of Tier-4 standards could lead to high concentrations of poisonous exhaust plumes in urban street canyons which may explain why gas turbines, and batteries have become the preferred backup power source for many data centers.  \nThe World Bank has announced the Thirsty Energy Initiative. The World Energy Council has published The Road to Resilience Report - Managing the Risks of the energy-water-food nexus. In April 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation presented the 2-year forecast which could lead to the first water shortage declaration in the Western United States. \nLet´s save water for drinking. Combine a gas turbine with Organic Rankin Cycle (ORC) technology for waste heat recovery without water in a  Heat ReCycle powerplant. Soon, cutting-edge technology will allow upgrading the gas turbine to burn 100% hydrogen in DLE (dry low emissions).  \nYou stand at the forefront of the energy transition.

The interests of operators and investors, on the one hand, and those of utilities and grids, on the other, are becoming more closely aligned. This is because ensuring a stable power supply as well as the financial success of the power plant are common goals.  \nThe biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built. It will apply novel process innovations to sustainably convert 100 percent wood into bio-based mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), mono-propylene glycol (MPG) as well as renewable functional fillers (RFF).  \nWith more widespread environmental awareness and the resultant striving for “green” lifestyles, biomass energy for both industry and electricity providers is a reliable – and sustainable – source of baseload power. \nIt also helps in meeting environmental targets, absorbing more CO₂ than it emits, and efficient equipment used in power generation leads to fewer emissions at the plant site. \nBiomass is a relatively cheap base load and, depending on the local regulations, surplus electricity produced from it can be fed back to the grid, making it even more economically viable. \nInstalling a biomass power plant to burn the on-site waste that occurs as a by-product of industrial processes closes the factory input cycle. \nIt also eliminates the need for waste disposal, lowers energy costs and maintains a high availability of the power supply. \nIncinerating renewables is thus a further step toward sustainability and toward a closed-cycle economy. These by-products need no additional processing, further strengthening the financial feasibility of the biomass plant. \nThe possibility of running a biomass plant on diverse feedstocks adds to the viability of such projects while ensuring the availability of the fuel supply. \nApart from achieving maximum output with a minimum of life-cycle costs, another decisive economic factor is the need for appropriate frameworks already in the country concerned, regulating such variables as electricity prices, the level of tipping tax, and funding. \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint.\n \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint. \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service.\n \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service. \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population.\n \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population. \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications.\n \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications. \nCapturing the potential of Vietnam biomass energy growth with tailor made high-efficiency steam turbines \nIndustries producing a large amount of process (biomass) waste can convert it into carbon-neutral energy to power their facilities or sell into the grid for additional revenue. \nReheat solutions significantly increase the overall efficiency of a biomass plant and are therefore an optimal solution to produce more energy without having to use more fuel. \nCo-generation with high-tech steam turbines and generators in sugar production. \nDownload the white paper \nPartnering with an experienced equipment manufacturer is an important step toward commissioning a new biomass plant. \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \nSiemens Energy achieves all annual goals and sets new targets for 2028 \nEarnings Release Q4 FY 2024: Siemens Energy achieves all annual goals and sets new targets for 2028 \nAd-hoc - Siemens Energy AG raises mid-term targets for fiscal year 2028 \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Biomass\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/biomass-to-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Exchange engine for industrial gas turbine applications\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/exchange-engine.html\" has the following content:\nSiemens can offer either a service exchange or lease of major assemblies and full core engine units, dependent upon suitability and availability. \nWhile your gas turbine is undergoing maintenance, Siemens can relieve the pressure of production schedules and minimize on-site disruption by providing you with a factory built service exchange core or major sub-assembly. \nSiemens service exchange units are built to current design standards, incorporating latest technical developments and fully tested to produce power within the original installed output.

Today’s emerging power systems are dominated by converter connected renewable power producers which are susceptible to decreased short circuit power and system inertia, making them more sensitive to electrical faults and sudden load imbalances. Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues. \nSynchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid. \nA synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events.  \nMore than 1,000 SGen-100A-2P/SGen-1000A generators are in commercial operation around the globe. \nCustomer: Power MachinesPower output: 227 MW\nApparent power: 227 MVA\nTerminal voltage: 15.75 kV\nFrequency: 50 HzScope: 1 x SGT5-4000F gas turbine, 1 x SGen5-1000A generator, and SPPA-T3000 I&C system\n \nOriginal OEM: BrushPower output: 3 x 105 MVA\nFrequency: 60 Hz\nTerminal voltage: 11 kVScope: SGen-100A-2P generator\n \nModernization and upgrade of 30years old generator (oOEM)Revamped direction of rotation optimizing the flow side inlet channels in the area of the rotor windingAdjusted dimensioning of individual components for higher currents and modified the base frame. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"SGen-1000A generator series\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgen-100a.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Integrated Electrolyzer & Heat Pump Solution\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/integrated-electrolyzer-heat-pump-solution.html\" has the following content:\nBoost the efficiency of hydrogen production while decarbonizing district heating: For the production of green hydrogen, typically 70-80% of the electrical energy is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, while the rest is converted into waste heat. With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating. By removing waste heat, the heat pump also provides cooling for the electrolyzer, minimizing the need for other cooling equipment.

The hydrogen can be easily stored for times when there is a shortage of renewable energy. At the same time, the heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer to produce heat at temperatures suitable for district heating. In times of renewable energy surplus, thermal power plants can be shut down because they are not needed for electricity or heat production. When heat production is higher than heat demand, the excess heat from the heat pump can be stored in thermal storage facilities. \nThese processes are working together for our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDuring periods of renewable energy shortage and high energy prices, the hydrogen can be fired in a thermal plant (e.g., a hydrogen-ready gas turbine cogeneration plant) to produce electricity and heat. The heat from the thermal storage covers periods of high heat demand but low electricity demand. The integration of renewable energy in heat production helps to decarbonize district heating. The integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution lowers the levelized cost of energy for both hydrogen production and heat production for district heating by minimizing energy losses.  \nElectrolyzer provides an efficiency of about 75%. An integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution increases energy utilization. This calculation is based on a solution with hydrogen production of 1005 kg/h at 80 barg with a heat pump for district heating as mentioned in the table below. Please follow the power flows of the process in the diagram. The energy utilization is increased up to 96% and more. \nAn integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution consists of the PEM electrolyzer (standard configuration for 335 kg/h and 1005 kg/h hydrogen are available), a high-temperature heat pump (8 MWth or 24 MWth; max. achievable temperature for district heating: up to 150°C), the control system and hydrogen as well as heat storage. \nClick on the plus icons to learn more about the different component of our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solutions \nPower-fully efficient \nWaste heat should not be wasted! Our solution increases the energy utilization of green hydrogen production from 75% to 96% or more. The heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer. It raises the temperature level and makes it usable for processes such as district heating. \nPower-fully intelligent \nOur solution provides automated and optimized operation through intelligent control that can manage energy supply and demand for electricity and heat, as well as reserve management. It uses real-time data in an autonomous and coordinated manner to ensure reliable 24/7 operation. \nPower-fully sustainable \nIntegrating renewable energy into heat production decarbonizes district heating. It helps to reduce emissions and meet decarbonization targets.

They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do. \nAs one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours.  \nDuring the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat.  \nLearn more about transforming heat production \nA new high-temperature industrial heat pump for the cooling center at Potsdamer Platz \nThe new river heat pump from MVV supplies climate-friendly heat from Rhine water to around 3,500 households - One of the largest heat pumps of its kind in Europe. \nFind out more about the MVV Mannheim, Germany \nHeat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. \nSiemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids.

As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​ \nThe ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​ \nStaying below allowed voltage fluctuations​ \nPower system equipment and loads require regulated voltage for proper operation. ​ \nStaying below critical frequency levels​ \nFrequency drift caused by fluctuations in generation or load must be mitigated. ​ \nLack of inertia​  \nAll generation resources must synchronize and remain synchronized through network disturbances.​ \nEmergency reaction​ \nSystem restoration, process of black starting and restoring the power system following a major outage.​ \nMost power electronic systems today use grid following (GFL) inverter controls. Due to their widespread use and growing installed capacity, it is important to understand the characteristics, dynamic behavior and potential contribution to grid reliability of these inverters.

Optimally protected by its cast-resin enclosure against normal and harsh environmental conditions, this maintenance-free transformer enables reliable operation while reducing total costs of ownership.  \nOur latest, innovative dry-type transformer, CAREPOLE was selected for 2022 EUISSCA Sustainable Supply Chain Award! CAREPOLE is an eco-friendly alternative for safer and more reliable distribution grids. \nAre you in need of a reliable, digital (Sensformer), eco-friendly and durable cast-resin transformer? We have an answer for you: CAREPOLE. \nCAREPOLE was developed by Siemens Energy for your overhead distribution line networks. CAREPOLE answers the challenges which transformers can possibly meet. Its windings are sealed with cast resin under vacuum, separated from the core, and the insulation is solid and resist the dielectric loads in the distribution network. The cast resin also protects your unit against severe weather conditions. High- and low-voltage bushings are cast in one piece with the windings. This technical design makes CAREPOLE especially reliable and unsusceptible to failures. Do you need an off-load tap changer? We can provide one near one of the top high-voltage bushings. It is set via a patented tap panel when the transformer is de-energized. \nWeatherproof design \nYour CAREPOLE withstands any weather conditions and ensures a reliable operation. The winding surfaces and core are in direct contact with the ambient air, resulting in efficient natural heat exchange. The frame surrounding the core creates a solid mechanical structure that protects the unit against corrosion and direct sunlight. The frame also serves as a lifting and fastening mechanism for the transformer. A special manufacturing process and advanced sealing compound ensure lownoise operation and perfect contact between frame and core. The core is wound from highquality electrical steel. The solid insulation of CAREPOLE is stable under all weather conditions and prevents moisture from penetrating the windings and core. \nOverload and short circuit capability \nCAREPOLE can withstand higher temperatures than liquid-filled transformers, due to the solid insulation. Accordingly, CAREPOLE units can be overloaded for longer periods of peak demand and can better withstand short-circuit effects. \nOne key factor of the energy market is sustainability. CAREPOLE makes power distribution grids safer and more environmentally friendly because it operates without flammable mineral oil-based insulating fluids. The cast resin used as insulation and for the body of the transformer has excellent electrical and mechanical properties, and is environmentally friendly and self­extinguishing. CAREPOLE does not pose any risk to water sources or nature reserves caused by oil leaks, tank explosions, soil contamination or fires in the event of a fault. Besides, CAREPOLE does not lose any fuel in the case of an external fire. These features can reduce the costs of liability insurance. They also increase the reliability of the distribution grid. \nCAREPOLE can be ordered with ready-to-use sensors, allowing you to perform your own monitoring. The connectivity system securely transmits operational data to an advanced analytics and visualization platform, providing you real-time insights into asset health and fleet status. With these digital features, potential failures can be quickly identified and addressed. You may even be able to prevent issues by detecting operational irregularities at an early stage. This transparency provided by CAREPOLE increases the reliability of your distribution grid, enabling smarter and more efficient operation. \nLearn more about our digital portfolio \nMaintenance-free \nCAREPOLE is very efficient in operation, and power loss is reduced to an absolute minimum. CAREPOLE is nearly maintenance- free, so your maintenance costs are negligible. Service activities are limited to checking the installation, vegetation conditions and wildlife management. The unit has a service life of 30+ years. There is no need to replace or change it during this time. \nEasy to install \nYou can directly replace liquidfilled overhead distribution transformers by CAREPOLE units of identical electrical power. They have identical fixing mechanisms to the pole and have been specifically developed for urban, rural or coastal outdoor installation. Installation and grid connection are particularly simple. Since CAREPOLE is a solid unit, it can be mounted at almost any angle on the pole and energized immediately after installation. \nYou can order CAREPOLE in the single-phase power range from  25 kVA to 50 kVA.

In addition to the traditional need to reliably, safely, and economically distribute electricity from the generator or incoming grid down to the consumers, there are new emerging challenges, including the need to implement governmental directives to save power, and to utilize the growing amount of renewable energy that's being fed into the grid, which is making grid control increasingly complex. The latter can result in voltage fluctuations and even cause plant downtime. SIPAPER Power allows you to safely and reliably engineer, plan, and realize your factory power distribution system while providing you with the tools to meet today's new demands and challenges. \nAt Progroup Paper AG’s paper factory of in Sandersdorf- Brehna, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, one of the most modern paper machines (PM3) is producing high-quality containerboard from wastepaper. We supply the power distribution and electrification, including the Sipaper DCS APL process control system based on Simatic PCS 7, as well as a multi-motor drive solution based on gearless drives with Sipaper Drives APL Standard. \nA pulp and paper mill places intensive demands on electricity supply and power management: High electricity loads must be distributed to different energy consumers safely, reliably, and economically. To satisfy these requirements with maximum efficiency, SIPAPER Power acts as a fully integrated electricity supply and power management system in combination with PCS 7 Power Control. It all starts at the planning stage of your paper mill’s new power network with the high, medium, and low voltage switchgear. \nSIPAPER Power performs everything – from controlling supply and distribution to open- and closed-loop control of all your loads. It's a fully integrated power distribution and management system for planning and monitoring the power supply for the complete process chain in your paper factory. This also includes a power supply for black starts and emergency power operation. In conjunction with intelligent control and switching devices and our integrated communications network, SIPAPER Power offers the right technical solutions for all of your requirements: high availability, adequate supply capacity, expandability and scalability, consistently high power quality, and environmental compatibility. It goes without saying that it's also economical, saves resources, and is easy to operate. \nSIPAPER Power includes all the necessary components to build a complex power distribution system for your mill, including power and distribution transformers, HV, MV, and LV switchgear in AIS or GIS versions, and appropriate protection systems. In addition a fully integrated energy management system (EMS/SCADA) based on Simatic PCS 7 provides you with all the functions you need to reliably monitor and operate  your mill distribution system. The EMS also includes an intelligent load management module that accurately determines the required loads to be shed and a generator management system (GMS) that optimizes your profits by running the generators in the most efficient range. \nWith SIPAPER Power you benefit from a dual energy-saving concept. First, we implement energy-efficient components that precisely match your requirements: for example, avoiding unnecessary over-rating that makes the components work in an inefficient range. Second, you'll benefit from the EMS/SCADA system that not only offers high transparency by monitoring and controlling the energy flows but also contributes to the overall optimization of energy resources with its generator management system (GMS) – by optimizing the generators to run in the most efficient range and monitoring the automatic load balancing of the turbine generator sets. \nThanks to sophisticated power control technology, SIPAPER Power gives you an overview of all processes in your electrical installations at all times and provides you with essential service information. The system monitors and records all switching processes throughout your entire factory using smart devices like Simocode®, Siprotec control, and fiber-optic networks. This allows you to predict load requirements and inform the operator, or take action to prevent the mill's power demand from rising to unacceptably high load peaks that result in extra charges. \nSIPAPER Power stands for power supply solutions from a single source – fully integrated and coordinated, across all voltage levels, and over the entire lifecycle. The network design starts with the collection of all relevant mill data, including consumer power requirements, starting characteristics of large drives, short-circuit capacity of all components, and grid parameters. Other criteria need to be considered in the engineering,for example, emergency and back-up concepts, mill availability and grid requirements. Finally to verify the mill's design and optimize the recovery time after a mill network or grid supply fault, dynamic network simulations based on fault scenarios are created to guarantee maximum reliability. \nOur Industry Services help make your machines and plants more profitable and efficient throughout their entire lifecycle, and allow you to exploit the opportunities of digitalization while reducing your total cost of ownership. \nWith our SIPAPER solutions, we help ensure success in the fiber industry worldwide. \nAny questions about energy systems?

We are knowledgeable of potential turbine-generator issues through significant fleet experience and have developed an enormous backlog of field processes, procedures, tooling and trained personnel to quickly address them. \nIn the current state of the energy market utility operators are in need of generators with resilience to meet the demands of generator operational flexibility. \nSiemens Energy generators have demonstrated a long service life, however the life of the generator is subject to normal aging processes which can manifest differently depending on the generator model and operational mode. \nIn today’s operating grid demands, normal aging processes can be exacerbated and accelerated by changes in operating modes, with many startup and shutdowns, frequent turning gear operation in standby mode and fast load changes in the part load range, which can apply greater stress to the individual generator components. \nComplete replacement is in some cases the more cost-effective alternative. A detailed cost/benefit analysis can help you decide if and when an investment in a new generator is economically beneficial compared to maintenance and service expenditures for the current generator. Siemens Energy can provide a matching generator for almost all generator types and configurations. \nSpecifically designed to replace smaller hydrogen- or water-cooled generator, the air-cooled Footprint™ generator is an easy to implement solution in which the existing foundations and interfaces can be used wherever possible. \nDetailed information about our Footprint™ concept \nWhen the power output of the turbine is increased, the generator capability needs to be adapted accordingly. Using specifically developed analysis measures, our Siemens Energy experts can quickly assess various options for uprating your generator and provide an individual proposal. \nSiemens Energy can offer the following measures for uprating your generator: \nThe continuously growing renewables share as well as volatile grids can have a significant impact on the synchronous condenser power production equipment and also on the transmission system operation. The consequences can be multifaceted. Remaining fossil units may be highly cycled and the energy flow in the transmission system complex. At the same time, the stability of a converter dominated transmission system is challenging. The frequency and voltage control as well as fault ride through capability can require installation of new additional equipment for stable and safe grid operation. \nA synchronous condenser is a turbo generator without turbines, connected to the grid via unit transformer, that can be implemented by one of the following options: \nIn power plants with several turbine generator sets, the implementation of an additional generator in synchronous condenser operation may represent the most cost-effective solution for increasing the plant output. The power factor in the existing generators is adjusted to produce more or even exclusive active power (MW). The missing reactive power fraction (MVAr) is to be compensated by the synchronous generator which is operated as a motor at zero load. The effort associated with the installation of an additional generator in the power plant architecture can be compensated for by the following advantages: \nFind further information about our portfolio of generators for synchronous condenser applications: \nGenerators portfolio \nWith any modernization it is important to verify that all of the measures in the power plant are coordinated.

With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster. \nIt's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible. \nOur clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances. \nNo single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces. \nOur new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines. \nAt Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. \nThis collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly. \nOur Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action. \nWe delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy. \n\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy. \nThanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution. \n\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett. \nThis high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity. \n\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development. \nWhen we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air. \n\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid. \nThe digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance. \n\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH. \nGet in contact with our Sales Support and Customer Service \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

They support air pollution control at thermal power plants, and various industrial plants.  \nA high voltage is applied to the discharge electrode, generating a corona discharge that produces negative ions. The electrically charged dust is accumulated on the collecting electrode by an electrical field. The accumulated dust is removed by rapping hammer (dry ESP), scraping brush (dry ESP), or flushing water (wet ESP). The most important consideration in ESP for coal-fired boiler applications is to maintain and increase the collection of high-resistivity dust.  \nSiemens Energy offers suitable technologies for plant applications and operations and combines compact design and high efficiency. \nW1C single phase thyristor – HV power supply for electrostatic precipitator \nThe operating mode of the electrostatic precipitator ESP (wet/ dry) is governed by the raw gas and particulate (aerosol) conditions. As electrostatic precipitators are used in virtually all process industries, conditions specific to plant processes such as startup/ shutdown operation, load cycling as well as varying gas conditions due to changed fuels/ raw materials must be considered.   \nElectrostatic precipitator – operation, visualization, data archiving, optimization and diagnostic \nThe SIPREC ODS application is based on Windows operating system and supports Siemens Energy high voltage power supply systems for electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). SIPREC ODS (SCADA) connects simultaneously to all high voltage power supply controllers for comfortable central operation, visualization and data archiving of measured operating values. SIPREC ODS enables optimization of ESP operation and diagnostics.   \nThyristor controller upgrade – HV power supply for electrostatic precipitator \nSIPREC C is a thyristor controller upgrade set for the retrofit of existing thyristor controller of different brands. The existing control cubicle with all power components (fused disconnector/ circuit breaker, main contactor, SCR-thyristor stack, CT) and peripheral components (interface relays, terminals etc.) are all reused.   \nIGBT inverter – HV power supply for electrostatic precipitator \nSIPREC I technology representsd the 4th generation of Siemens inverter technology, specifically designed for the kind of high voltage power supply required by ESPs.

As part of this transformation we expanded our own gas turbine test facility in the town of Finspång, Sweden, to become a model of the future energy system.  \nTogether with international partners within the research project Zero Emission Hydrogen Turbine Center (ZEHTC) we set up a demonstration plant to showcase a flexible and sustainable energy system connecting gas turbines with hydrogen, renewable energy and energy storage. This provided valuable insights to be able to accelerate into a decarbonized energy future. \nOnsite hydrogen production from renewables and excess electricity \nHydrogen enabling decarbonization of gas turbine operation \nPlatform for sharing know-how on flexible energy systems and hydrogen solutions \nEnabling extended testing toward 100 percent hydrogen capability \nWatch our video to learn more \nThe demonstrator plant provides valuable insights to be able to accelerate into a decarbonized energy future. \nRead more about the project and all the partners on our partner website \nThe test center opens up multiple possibilities: Excess energy from gas turbine tests and electricity from solar panels is used to produce hydrogen in an electrolyzer. The energy is stored as compressed hydrogen and in batteries. \nThis way a closed loop plant is created, producing its own hydrogen for our continued research and development to optimize the use of hydrogen in gas turbines. All this also while supporting our goal to be able to run our gas turbines on 100% hydrogen by 2030. \nClick on the labels to learn more about the components of the solution \nSo, what is the role of gas turbines in a sustainable energy system?  \nGas turbines have proven to be very effective in balancing intermittent renewable energy production due to their flexibility and short ramp-up times. According to the International Energy Agency, gas turbines will play an important role in providing flexibility in the electrical grid in a Sustainable Development Scenario. \nAs of today, the gas turbines we're testing in our new Zero Emission Hydrogen Turbine Center are ready to burn up to 75% of hydrogen in the fuel mix. And step by step we aim to reach 100% by 2030. \nGas turbines with hydrogen as fuel have great potential to provide more stability in future energy systems that involve increasing shares from renewable sources without increasing carbon emissions.  \nAs power from solar and wind is highly volatile and does not always match the energy demand, hydrogen – produced from these green energy sources – can be used as an energy storage solution. The subsequent combustion of hydrogen results in zero carbon emissions. \nGas turbines provide in themselves renewable power when running on hydrogen, or any other fossil-free fuel like e-fuels (i.e. e-methanol, e-diesel, e-methane) or bio-fuels (i.e. bio-methanol, ethanol, or bio-diesel). \nAs we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volat...\n \nAs we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volat... \nDownload: Hydrogen power and heat with Siemens Energy gas turbines  \n \nDownload: Hydrogen power and heat with Siemens Energy gas turbines   \nThe 'hydrogen economy' looks at changing the hydrocarbon-based infrastructure and running ...\n \nThe 'hydrogen economy' looks at changing the hydrocarbon-based infrastructure and running ... \nHow a research project is paving the way for hydrogen-based energy systems.

Fuel consumption, as the greatest single cost item, holds the biggest cost-saving potential for a ship’s operation. Moreover, the choice of a suitable propulsion system influences a whole host of other factors. For instance, quiet operation with low vibration will heighten onboard comfort. Power reserves and maneuverability will increase the vessel’s potential commercial value. And a modular, space-saving drive design will afford more flexibility when planning the layout of your ship. Our integrated drive system concepts help you find the right technology for your purposes.   \nWe offer future-proof electric propulsion/drives solutions for the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of commercial as well as naval vessels. \nOur two diesel-electric marine propulsion systems reduce fuel requirements, increase maneuverability, minimize environmental risks, and make your ship quieter and more comfortable. \nDesigned without compromising power output and fail-safe performance, our Drive MV integrated drive system offers an almost unlimited power range. \nIn the Permasyn motor for submarines, excitation is achieved with permanent magnets. This results in outstanding features in terms of uncompromising reliability and operational readiness. \nSiemens Energy developed the SGM shaft generator with motor function in response to rising fuel costs and ever-stricter environmental regulations. \nWith SISHIP BlueDrive Eco, the SISHIP BlueDrive family is now offering scalable solutions for all drive requirements, covering diverse performance graduations for small to medium-sized drives, from 5 KW in auxiliary mode up to 5.5 MW in main drives. \nWith their outstanding reliability, minimized noise signature, and stray field development, Siemens Energy DC-Prop DC drives are perfectly suitable for operation in submarines. \nDiesel-electric propulsion systems are gaining more and more importance in shipping. Shipping installations with higher fuel efficiency in all operational stages will be increasingly favored and will presumably have great potential for future growth. Drive LV is the leading technology solution. \nDiesel-electric marine propulsion systems reduce fuel requirements, increase maneuverability, minimize environmental risks, and make your ship quieter and more comfortable. However, their main advantage lies in the exceptional degree of fail-safety that Drive LV attains, thanks to its redundant system design. Indeed, Drive LV is the most reliable diesel-electric propulsion system ever built, making it a future-proof solution which helps to ensure the competitiveness of your vessels for the long term. \nProfit from a perfectly planned system consisting of diesel generators, low-voltage switchgear, frequency converter, and drive motors in combination with an ingenious propulsion control and monitoring system.  \nYour advantages with Drive LV  \nDiesel-electric propulsion systems are clearly superior both technically and in operation to normal diesel drive systems in almost all areas. Drive MV is the marine industry’s leading alternating-current propulsion system. Although it can unleash much power, it runs as quiet as a whisper with low vibration. \nDesigned without compromising power output and fail-safe performance, our Drive MV integrated drive system offers an almost unlimited power range. In addition to its high energy efficiency and low environmental impact, it is also marked by its quiet, low-vibration operation. And thanks to its state-of-the-art propulsion-control components and software, Drive MV allows vessels to be maneuvered with the highest precision. \nIts redundancy design ensures the highest possible level of reliability. Right from the design phase, its simple, compact, and modular construction using standardized components provides maximum flexibility and scope and allows for worldwide availability of spare parts and ease of maintenance. \nYour advantages with Drive MV \nSubmarines are the vessels that depend most on the complete reliability and operational readiness of their propulsion motors. A drive system that operates efficiently with very low signatures is essential for long dives and makes the boat harder to detect. The Permasyn motor for submarines is smaller and more lightweight than conventional propulsion solutions – and it achieves much better efficiency at extremely low signatures. \nIn the Permasyn motor for submarines, excitation is achieved with permanent magnets. This results in outstanding features in terms of uncompromising reliability and operational readiness, combined with high efficiency and extremely low signature values. The replacement of the electrical exciter by a permanent magnet makes possible extremely small and lightweight motors with high power density and high torque over the entire speed range. This enables the use of a larger propeller with significantly higher efficiency. \nYour advantages with Permasyn \nSpiraling fuel costs and anticipated emission controls already feature strongly in the early design stage of a ship. With the SGM shaft generator with motor function, your vessels are best equipped to meet the necessary criteria. \nSiemens Energy developed the SGM shaft generator with motor function in response to rising fuel costs and ever-stricter environmental regulations. It incorporates motor- and generator-driven operation in the vessel’s main drive system, and can be used for electrical power generation as well as for boosting the main drive system. At the same time, it significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions. The SGM shaft generator is available with either low- or medium-voltage technology and can be combined with waste-heat recovery or hybrid solutions to increase drive performance. \nYour advantages with SGM \nSiemens Energy has over many years created a wide portfolio and extensive competence within the field of power electronics and propulsion systems. By changing the conventional propulsion system configuration and implementing a totally new control philosophy, the ultra-compact SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC™ system is created. With this system a whole new set of possibilities and advantages opens. \nWith the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC electric propulsion system, individual speed control of each engine over the entire engine speed region is possible. This is true, even for full diesel-electric vessels independent of synchronous speed. The control system will dynamically set the speed according to the at-all-times optimal operational point of the engine. With this, the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC control system secures that the diesel engines are operating at the lowest possible specific fuel consumption (g/kWh). During DP operation the advantages are substantial, because production and even spinning reserve can be realized with limited consumption, emission, and maintenance costs. To lower the fuel consumption even more, the system makes possible load shifting between the port and starboard parts of the system. \nYour advantages with SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC \nThe synchronous generators are designed to operate in the same speed and power range as the connected diesel engine. Due to extended development of the power electronics, the main drive unit SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC is created as a stand-alone, integrated unit, including the generator and bus-tie panel as well as the frequency converter controls for all thrusters and auxiliary drives. In addition, the unit provides clean power supply to all auxiliary consumers, and all electronics are based on known and well-proven technology. In addition to the operational advantages, the new unit reduces footprint, volume, and weight by at least 30 percent. \nThe SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC unit is equipped with an integrated control system that realizes all genset control, drive control and power management functions within the unit itself. The speed and power of the diesel engines is controlled in correspondence with the total power consumption of the vessel. The electric system is only fed with active power from the generators; hence there is no circulating reactive power to handle. The speed and power characteristics of the diesel engine will be parameterized according to the selected diesel engine type. Integrated parts of the system are Power Management (PMS), Power Plant Protection (P3) and Generator Power Adaption Systems (GPA). All these systems are integrated in the integrated control system of the SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC. \nSISHIP BlueDrive Eco combines the experience from both systems SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC and SISHIP EcoProp. SISHIP EcoProp is well known as a flexible, compact, high-power diesel-electric propulsion system for smaller vessels such as yachts, ferries, and public authority vessels. Like the complete SISHIP BlueDrive family, SISHIP BlueDrive Eco uses the Siemens Energy industrial converter platform components, providing very high reliability and availability. It enables scalable systems from 5 kW inverter power use and closes the power range (to SISHIP BlueDrive PlusC up to 5.5 MW inverter power), all in the same topology. \nThe advanced lithium-ion battery-based solution BlueVault for offshore installations and marine vessels is suited for both all-electric and hybrid energy-storage applications. BlueVault energy storage solutions are designed to help ensure continuity of power and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions.  \nThe battery is designed to maximize life, performance, and safety. It is equipped with an integrated battery management system and overload/short circuit protection. The storage modules with 6.6 kWh Li-Ion batteries can be slid into a rack. The battery storage cubicle consists of 9 modules and 60 kWh. The cubicles can be easily lined up to the total required battery capacity. \nSubmarine drives need to be able to withstand the toughest demands. On long missions and under extreme conditions they must also be able to function perfectly to ensure maximum security for the boat and crew. They also demand low signatures, high efficiency, and easy-to-maintain, space-saving, and lightweight modules. With its strong focus on these demands, our DC-Prop for submarines are a favorite option for some type of submarines. \nWith their uncompromising performance, absolutely reliable operation, and minimized noise signature and stray field development, Siemens Energy DC-Prop DC drives are perfectly suitable for operation in submarines. Additional benefits are their high energy efficiency and maintenance-friendly, space-saving construction using ultra-lightweight components. \nYour advantages with DC Prop \nIf you want to learn more about our offering for the marine sectors, don’t hesitate to contact us.

The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do. \nAs one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours.  \nDuring the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO2-free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat.  \nLearn more about transforming heat production \nA new high-temperature industrial heat pump for the cooling center at Potsdamer Platz \nThe new river heat pump from MVV supplies climate-friendly heat from Rhine water to around 3,500 households - One of the largest heat pumps of its kind in Europe. \nFind out more about the MVV Mannheim, Germany \nHeat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. \nSiemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids. The refrigerants have negligible environmental impact in all aspects: \nAs responsible manufacturers, we see refrigerants as a design element of a heat pumps system. We will use the optimum refrigerant for the specific solution. \nDecarbonizing heat: The hot topic we can't ignore \nHeat accounts for around half of global energy consumption, contributing 40% of CO2 emissions. On the way to carbon neutrality, we thus can no longer ignore the topic. In an excellent article Christian Hüttl and Norbert Wenn outline the tools to green heat - at home, in buildings and in industry. \nMaking the most of waste heat \nBefore the end of 2022, at Potsdamer Platz in the German capital Berlin, a novel hightemperature industrial heat pump will start supplying the city’s district heating system with net-zero heat. This is a pioneering project on the way to decarbonizing heat. \nGerman utility deploys river heat pump to decarbonize heating \nSiemens Energy is supplying a large-scale river heat pump to Mannheim-based utility MVV in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

To achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP), it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating F-gases from electrical switchgear – particularly SF6, a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2. \nOur Blue portfolio uses clean air and vacuum switching technology instead. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment. \nLess global warming potential is not good enough. It has to be Zero, because 1% global warming potential is still global warming potential. It has to be Zero and it has to be now. \nNikola Jankulovski \nSiemens Energy Project Lead \nWe’ve recently invested €60 million in our Berlin facility to step up production of vacuum interrupters for our Blue portfolio. This will help to secure our supply chain – and since the plant uses 100% renewable energy, it will also increase our sustainability. \nOur Blue products use vacuum switching technology and clean air insulation to produce Zero harmful emissions - and without having to compromise on performance or economic feasibility. With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster. \nIt's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible. \nOur clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances. \nNo single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces. \nOur new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines. \nAt Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. \nThis collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly. \nOur Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action. \nWe delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy. \n\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy. \nThanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution. \n\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett. \nThis high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity. \n\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development. \nWhen we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air. \n\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid. \nThe digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance. \n\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH. \nGet in contact with our Sales Support and Customer Service \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

We support projects from conceptual design through commercial operation and beyond. Our CAES solution includes all the associated above ground systems, plant engineering, procurement, construction, installation, start-up services and long term service support. \nAs renewable power generation from wind and solar grows in its contribution to the world’s energy mix, utilities will need to balance the generation variability of these sustainable resources with demandfluctuations. Power-generation operators can use compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology for a reliable, cost-effective, and long-duration energy storage solution at grid scale.  \nSiemens Energy CAES improves utilization of renewable energy resources by absorbing GW-hours of energy that would otherwise be curtailed and provides grid balancing and reserve services with lower fuel usage and carbon footprint than other controllable resources.  \nDiabatic storage units dissipate part of the compression heat into the atmosphere with intercoolers. The air must be reheated to be returned to the CAES cycle. Energy and ancillary services with low fuel consumption provide best efficiency. \nThe adiabetic CAES cycle stores energy in form of pressure in a cavern, while compression heat is stored in a thermal storage.

Among other things, this means our proven Omnivise T3000 control system security protection will be enhanced with Tenable OT Security at the core. \nSiemens Energy and National Academic and Non-profit Partners announced a new Cybersecurity & Industrial Infrastructure Security Apprenticeship Program (CIISAp). \nBlog: Building the Next Generation of Industrial Cyber Defenders \nEos.ii™ is the first AI-based monitoring and detection platform that can serve as the foundation for securing industrial IoT in an era of persistent cyberattacks \nHere's why: \nEnergy companies increasingly recognize that their likelihood of being attacked is nearly 100% and that they must strengthen their agility and resiliency so they can respond when - not if - they are attacked. \nGovernments are responding to the growing cyber threat by rolling out comprehensive critical infrastructure regulations. But there is a difference between being compliant and being secure. \nIncreased connectivity, automation, and data-driven operations makes a strong cybersecurity program essential. \nSiemens Energy, Saudi Aramco and the World Economic Forum launched a cybersecurity playbook for the oil and gas industry. The report, “Cyber Resilience in the Oil and Gas Industry Playbook”, establishes a blueprint for boards and business leaders to evaluate cyber risk and enhance cyber resilience across the industry. \nEos.ii™ empowers CISOs and SOCs with the platform and insights needed to scale up security to meet the demands of IoT business models. It offers unmatched capabilities to help energy and critical infrastructure organizations build and maintain robust, adaptable, and resilient defenses in a fast-moving and competitive IoT future. \nManaged Detection and Response (MDR) powered by Eos.ii™ is an AI-based service, powered by Siemens Energy’s revolutionary monitoring platform. It provides energy companies with the visibility and context to shine a light into industrial operating environment to stop attacks before they occur. \nThis white paper offers an example of an attack against a fictional electric utility, as it manages an unfolding crisis and illustrates how incident response planning can make a difference in reaching the least disruptive outcome. \nWind farm developers, owners, and operators share an interest in cybersecurity risk manage ment strategies that account for the full life cycle of these assets. To ensure secure reliable renewable power delivery, offshore wind farms should be built and operated with a secure by design approach, with systems-level integration in mind, and with the understanding that the threat environment will continue to evolve long after construction is complete.  \nThis MIT Technology Review report gathers insights from leading practitioners in the oil and gas sector to better understand how global companies are applying advanced digital technologies to both improve efficiency and protect themselves from cyberattacks — and why AI is the key to unlocking and securing the energy transition. \nThis report from the Ponemon Institute highlights the unique cybersecurity requirements for  for the Utility industry. \nIn conjunction with the Ponemon Institute, this report delves into the cyber readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East. \nLearn how US companies in the oil and gas industry are addressing cybersecurity risks in the operational technology (OT) environment. \nOur offering:\nGap analysis \nWhat you will get:\nFindings report that includes both a critical gap summary and a roadmap for recommended remediation \nOur offering:\nIncident response planning and testing \nWhat you will get:\nDetailed plan on how to respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including emergency procedures, roles, and resources \nOur offering:\nFirewall assessment and patch management \nWhat you will get:\nFindings and recommendations for heightened security; malware pattern updates and management \nOur offering:\nSecurity event monitoring system \nWhat you will get:\nReal-time monitoring by collecting and parsing security logs \nOur broad portfolio combines leading industry technologies and tools with expert know-how \nSiemens Energy, along with its technology partner Darktrace, brings real-time anomaly detection to the industrial OT environment. Siemens Energy Plant Security Monitoring service provides the continuous visibility required to make smarter, faster decisions. \nThe Siemens Energy Vulnerability Management solution provides a non-intrusive way to discover, visualize, and monitor sensitive systems continuously. We provide technical support for designing, deploying, and enabling Tenable's unique software on the control system network to provide a complete picture across the network. \nPlant managers often lack an up-to-date, comprehensive asset inventory of all connected assets. Siemens Energy, in conjunction with PAS™, helps our customers meet this challenge with automated Cyber Asset Management. This includes configuration change management and advice on potential cybersecurity threats. \nMany energy companies keep their networks unconnected because they believe this makes them cyber secure. This misguided strategy will fall victim to more successful attacks, from inside and outside. Connectivity gives you visibility which provides insight. \nMany companies do not know what assets and devices exist on their OT networks. \nThis limits their understanding of where their infrastructure is most vulnerable. \nMost energy companies have focused on building up their IT cyber capabilities. But these cannot be simply deployed into the OT environment because of differences in the systems, data, devices, and critical dependencies. Because of this inattention to OT, cybersecurity experts who can secure complex, aging, and interdependent infra-structure are hard to find. \nOT systems are older than IT systems. OT equipment, which can last decades, is often developed with proprietary systems that have exposures and vulnerabilities difficult to protect. \nEven if a company detects a potential intrusion into its OT cybersecurity environment, it may lack the plans or capabilities to respond effectively. \nCyber solutions must apply across multiple vendors to provide a single, seamless cyber program. \nIf you say “yes” to one or more of the questions above, you are not alone. For energy companies, the probability of a cyber attack is nearly 100%.   \nOvercoming the fear of connectivity is essential because the benefits of digitalization are too great. Organizations must focus on agility and resiliency so they can respond when – not if – they are attacked. \nWe combine our deep OT know-how with cutting-edge technology from selected partners to provide end-to-end solutions for every step in our customers' cybersecurity journey. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Cybersecurity for Energy\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service-offerings/digital-services/cybersecurity.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Gas-insulated switchgear\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/gas-insulated-switchgear.html\" has the following content:\nWith the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct.  \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and zero toxicity is by using clean air. Gas-insulated switchgear combine vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nEnabling higher voltage levels ​for wind turbines​. It is essential to live energy transition and increase resource efficiency. ​Wind power generation is making a major contribution for the  growing power demand and a new generation of wind power plants require innovative technologies. ​Our compact, environmentally friendly, high-voltage gas-insulated 8VM1 Blue GIS for on- & offshore installations up to 72.5 kV is an optimal contribution to enlarged wind turbine power and reduced cable losses. \nThe 8VN1 Blue GIS maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2. \nAlso in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV.  \nLPITs are innovative voltage and current transformers providing a safe, reliable and standardized solution for measurement and protection applications in GIS. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan.\nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan. \nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nThe 8VM1 Blue GIS® is now certified to withstand real earthquake conditions. The qualification level was tested “high”, which ensures structural integrity and continuous functionality during highest loads. \nResilience for high-voltage equipment: An 8VN1 Blue GIS typical bay for the 145 kV level successfully passed seismic qualification shake-table tests in line with IEEE 693 high level specifications. Neither the specimen nor the support structure sustained any structural damage or suffered from impaired functionality as a result of the tests. \nCerius is the first utility in Denmark to order a Clean Air insulated switchgear with vacuum switching technology. \nNetze BW, Burladingen, Germany \nSiemens Energy has delivered more than 4000 units of sustainable transformers and gasinsulated switchgear for the installation in the nacelles and towers of offshore wind parks. This is an important contribution to the expansion of renewable energy sources, which is in line with the outcome of the latest world energy forum report. Besides, it supports the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  \nSiemens Energy has been awarded the contract to deliver ten bays of Blue gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) to Fingrid, Finland’s transmission system operator. It will be the first GIS in Finland that replaces F-gases with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with zero potential for global warming. This will be the most significant Blue installation to date. \nYou can find informational materials on our gas-insulated switchgear here. \nCustomer Support Center \nCustomer support center  \nRegister for upcoming events & webinars \nSiemens Energy fairs, events & webinars \nSiemens Energy Downloads \nWhitepapers & Recordings \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Gas-insulated switchgear\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/gas-insulated-switchgear.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Additive Manufacturing\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/additive-manufacturing.html\" has the following content:\nBe it rapid prototyping or manufacturing parts for aero-derivative, gas and steam turbines or compressors, they can be designed faster, with increased flexibility, better materials, and optimized efficiency.

The company’s additive manufacturing capabilities comprise mechanized cladding, micro laser welding, cold spray silver coating and laser metal deposition. \nThe inauguration of the prototype of a serial production line at the gas turbine factory in Berlin marks an important milestone for the IDEA project. It is part of the initiative “Line integration of additive manufacturing processes”, funded by German Ministry of Education and Research. \nSiemens Energy is driving the industrialization and commercialization of AM processes. Here are some examples of 3D printed parts working in the real world. \nSelective laser melting (SLM), also known as direct metal laser melting (DMLM) or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is a rapid prototyping, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM) technique designed to use a high power-density laser to melt and fuse metallic powders together. SLM is often considered a subcategory of selective laser sintering (SLS). The SLM process has the ability to fully melt the metal material into a solid three-dimensional part unlike SLS. \nLaser cladding is a form of surface coating that incorporates the use of lasers and a feeding mechanism to coat the substrate with a layer of desired metal or ceramic material. The laser melts the metal and coats the moving substrate with a fine layer. The feed metal is fully melted while the laser also transfers some of its energy to the substrate. This allows for the creation of a strong metallurgical bond between the substrate and the coating. \nWire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a large-scale metal AM technology that uses an arc welding process to produce metal parts additively. \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy.\n \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy. \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems.\n \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems. \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions.\n \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions. \nPlease fill out the form below and receive your download link! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Additive Manufacturing\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/additive-manufacturing.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"LIFE OCEAN\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/life-ocean.html\" has the following content:\nThe LIFE OCEAN project is the first project which aims to use a carbon-neutral fuel for electric energy production on a Sanlorenzo superyacht \nThe maritime sector represents about 13.5% the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at EU level (Source: EEA, 2021). In order to foster decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector, the IMO fixed a target of 80% cut of GHG emissions until 2050 and cut of 100% until 2100. The path towards decarbonization of fuels in the maritime sector will also lead to the reduction and/or abatement of pollutants like CO, NOX, SOX, PM, BC, HC that are emitted by fossil fuels combustion. The installation of a methanol reformer coupled to a HTPEM fuel cell could represent an interesting solution as auxiliary power unit of yachts and superyachts, to cover the hotel load but also to sustain slow speed cruising and maneuvering operations in ports. \nAim of the LIFE OCEAN (onboard clean energy and no-noise) project is to substitute the traditional diesel generators used to cover the hotel loads of a Sanlorenzo superyacht with a methanol-based fuel cell system. Along with air pollution mitigation, on board noise will be abated while underwater noise will be reduced thanks to the elimination of diesel generators. The solution adopted constitutes a zero-carbon technology for the maritime sector, adopting green methanol whose large capacity production is growing at both EU and extra-EU level. \nInstead of methanol the project will foster the adoption of green methanol (methanol produced by renewable sources, i.e. from agricultural and forestry residues, biogas, organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, synthesis of H2 produced from electrolytic processes and CO2 coming from carbon capture technologies). \nFurthermore, methanol is easy to store and handle, it is biodegradable and does not contain sulphur. It is liquid at environmental temperature and pressure, it presents a good energy density (around 22 MJ/kg) and does not need cryogenic tanks for its storage like LNG.  \n1. Step\nFirst, the sustainable produced methanol needs to be mixed with water to enable the electrochemical reaction in the reformer. To safe space, weight and hence energy on the vessel it is our goal to find a solution to reuse the water produced in the fuel cell instead of installing a water tank. Resulting in an onboard water cycle and savings of this valuable resource.\n \n1.

They are designed to customer specifications and API 617 standards. Compression solutions can be supplied in a variety of configurations from skid mounted, combining the compressor with its driver and auxiliaries, to single lift process modules where we can fully integrate compressors, drivers and process equipment such as coolers, scrubbers, separators, piping, and wiring. Module fabrication can be done in our yard or contracted out to qualified yards in destination countries to fulfill local content requirements.       \nCovering a wide performance range in terms of pressure ratio and volume flow, our horizontally split single-shaft compressors can compress gases with suction temperatures as low as required for LNG boil-off gas service (-160 °C / -256 °F). \nSeveral process stages can be housed in each casing depending on process requirements. These include straight-through, back-to-back or double flow configurations while side streams and intercooling can be accommodated as well. Up to three casings can be arranged in line to be driven by a single prime mover.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker. \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and Zero toxicity is by using clean air. The 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker combines vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nThe clean air used – consisting of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free of humidity – can be released into the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to people or the environment.  This represents a vital step towards the goal of achieving Zero GWP throughout the energy grid.\n \nAt the same time, the 3AV1 live tank circuit breaker maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe.\n \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nAt Hesseln substation, Germany, Siemens Energy and grid operator Westnetz are showing how innovation can drive decarbonization and digitalization in energy transmission. \nImplementation of the innovative vacuum switching technology in combination with a digitally enhanced circuit-breaker for transmission grid operator (TSO) ENEA. \nDealing with emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy grids worldwide will require more than just adding carbon-free generation from wind, solar, hydropower, and other sources. We have to eliminate man-made climate change gases like SF6, says Tom Rak, a consultant on greenhouse gas issues. \nBy Frank Jossi \nNetze BW, Noerdlingen, Germany \nWhile we are fully committed to the implementation of clean air technology, the fact is that in the short term there may be circumstances where it cannot yet be used, such as the need for super-high voltage levels. For these situations, we continue to offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nOur high-voltage circuit breakers, regardless of type or voltage range, are designed in a well proven modular platform concept.

There are various factors which have an influence on this decision. By providing support for system analysis, such as for visual inspection or early grid studies, Siemens Energy’s experts can support system operators with these decisions. There’s no such thing as a general rule of thumb here, because operating modes and strategies, business goals, and external factors differ considerably. \nBasically, there are four main reasons for refurbishment. The Siemens Energy experts help carve out the requirements of both the operator and the individual HVDC / FACTS system, or high-voltage switchyard and finally deliver a solution that ensures smooth and successful refurbishment. \nHVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears have a typical lifetime of about 40 years, considering regular and proper maintenance. The typical service life of control and protection equipment as well as other control devices, however, is much shorter. A customized retrofit with state-of-the-art technology enables the system’s performance to be maintained and ensures reliable power transmission and power quality throughout the entire system lifetime. \nThanks to their robust technology, HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgears boast a long service life. In many cases a substantial refurbishment can extend this service life even further by allowing for ideal operation modes. This helps keep maintenance costs at bay and defer the need for a new system considerably. \nGrid conditions can change during the service life of a high-voltage transmission system or switchyard. The increasing amount of renewable power infeed may have led to a decreased short circuit level. A changed grid configuration may have prompted additional harmonics to occur. The increasing degree of digitalization may require adjustments and modifications of the secondary systems to ensure competitive operation. In other cases, operators have changed their business model and require an adaption to the actual needs such as adapted ratings or other operating points. Targeted refurbishment measures help cushion such effects. \nRefurbishment measures can help optimize losses as well as the utilization of a system’s transmission and overload capabilities and in this way increase the profitability of a transmission system noticeably and sustainably. In other cases, the implementation of black start capability can boost both the technical and the economic benefit of an existing system.  \nThree basic questions help system operators identify required and advisable measures, define the scope of works, and determine adequate procedures. Siemens Energy provides support in finding the right answer with system assessments, business case analyses, and adequate pre-studies. \nHigh-voltage solutions are unique and complex. Various options for refurbishments exist. To define the right scope and target for the refurbishment, please find below a variety of Siemens Energy’s high-voltage refurbishment portfolio: \nReasons for HVDC and FACTS systems as well as high-voltage switchgear refurbishment are very individual. These range from cybersecurity issues to the need for control and protection updates, adaptions to changed grid conditions, the implementation of black start capability, and desired performance increases all the way up to the expectable end of life of a system’s key components. \nSiemens Energy helps find out whether refurbishment measures make sense, define the scope, and create a customized project plan.  \nNo refurbishment measure is like the other and many things need to be considered. Costs need to be analyzed and the question of financing options may arise. Project steps and specifications need to be defined meticulously and the possible timeframe to be evaluated. Finally, system operators need to know exactly what they’ll have to do in the course of the project. \nSiemens Energy offers workshops and consulting to analyze the exact requirements and to define the ideal procedure. Siemens Energy can also help issue budgets to define investment costs and can provide financial support. \nFinding the right time for a refurbishment measure is crucial – and it’s never easy. Along with the question when has the time come to change system elements or rather an entire station, the availability of required spare parts needs to be clarified. Also, the outage time and its duration must be defined while keeping an eye on the need for an efficiently running power system. \nWhile regular maintenance and checks performed by Siemens Energy experts help increase a system’s lifetime and manage possible obsolescence, component monitoring systems enable predictive maintenance.  \nSiemens Energy has already carried out numerous HVDC, high-voltage switchgear, and FACTS refurbishments for system operators around the world. Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting projects. \nThe Siemens Energy experts are there to support you right from the beginning of your refurbishment project. They’ll ensure that all measures are based on your individual business case and this way protect your competitiveness. Siemens Energy experts will introduce their entire know-how to evaluate the viability of the project, help optimize the refurbished system’s design, and support you in defining the scope of works as well as in planning the project schedule and the outage times. Site visits and the documentation of remaining parts together with the operating and maintenance staff ensure maximum system transparency. Continuous dialogue and health checks provide maximum planning security.

Reaching them won’t come about by itself. Apart from intelligent energy management and improved energy efficiency, we need to decarbonize power generation for utilities and industry. And since we can’t rebuild energy generation from scratch, assets viewed as burdensome today, such as coal power plants, must be repurposed as bridges to a new energy future. It’s called Brownfield Transformation: Converting existing power plants, so they help us reach the decarbonized economy we all aim for.  \nBrownfield Transformation: Building a bridge to a new energy future \nInnovative solutions for gas-fired power plants \nAs the world enters a new energy age, you’re looking for affordable solutions to reduce emissions while ensuring a reliable and safe power supply. But your fossil power plants hardly fit into a decarbonized future. So, you're faced with the decision to build either a new plant on a greenfield – or convert a brownfield power plant into a new productive asset.  \nBrownfield transformation is a holistic approach to decarbonizing legacy coal, oil and gas-fired power plants combined with the use of existing assets and infrastructure. For example, repowering steam power plants with new gas turbines. It also lays the foundation for a mid-term solution: turning existing brownfield power plants into decarbonized hybrid power plants, which could include power generation from renewable energy sources, various storage technologies, and grid stability services. All of this lays the groundwork for future net zero energy systems. Such systems could facilitate sector coupling by integrating renewables, industry, or mobility sectors with the help of green hydrogen.  \nIf your decarbonization needs turn out to be rather complex, we advise undertaking a detailed Energy System Design, which comprises a data-based integrated technology & business case study that examines future revenue streams and site surroundings using the available decarbonization portfolio. If technology preselection, e.g., fuel switch, energy storage, heat pumps, etc. is an important factor for you, we can develop your project directly. Whatever your approach, in the end your solution will be a combination of technology components tailored to your business case, market demands as well as efficiency and decarbonization goals. \nNo matter which solution you choose for your brownfield power plant conversion, there are numerous potential benefits: avoiding stranded assets; less investment compared to greenfield projects; shorter implementation time, including fewer permits to apply for. At the same time, you may even open new revenue streams. Apart from these advantages, brownfield conversion could also help further your reputation while you contribute to the common good. Altogether, not only will you support decarbonization efforts, but continuing to employ qualified personnel can also significantly ease socioeconomic strains on local communities. \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir...\n \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir... \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe...\n \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe... \nWe are on the way to a carbon-free future, but we won't get there overnight.

Electricity and heating are major cost factors for industrial plants. That means there’s a long-term cost benefit in having your own power plant at your factory, mining, or production facility. It also helps you achieve climate goals and stay ahead of the competition. We will create just the right power plant solution for your purposes. \nGlobal megatrends and the energy transformation redefine the requirements for competitiveness in all energy-intensive industries. Reliable, economical and environmentally compatible supplies of power, steam, heating and cooling play an increasingly important role. Get ready for the future with us: Concentrate on your core business, while we help you manage your energy supply. \nEvery industry, every factory, and every facility has its own unique demands for power supply. That’s why we configure and optimize your system individually, from the initial design to the final component. It goes without saying that we incorporate technologies proven in hundreds of facilities and over thousands of operating hours. Another factor that cuts your project risk: We pre-manufacture entire modules and test them away from the construction site. This means much less expense incurred on-site at your facility. \nSiemens Energy has a thorough understanding of the processes in your industry. After all, we’ve been building, expanding, and modernizing all kinds of industrial facilities for decades. We know that production processes have to be closely interlinked with ancillary activities like electricity and heat generation and energy distribution. Only once everything is integrated can the opportunities for automation and digitalization be exploited to the full. \nProcessing mineral raw materials requires a vast amount of energy. That’s why procuring electricity and heat makes up a significant proportion of operating costs. Entities that supply their own electricity and heat using their own power plant will enjoy significant cost savings. And with a sturdy, state-of-the-art combined cycle power plant, they can also substantially improve their environmental life cycle assessment. \nFrom production to transportation and refining – the oil and gas business is getting tougher. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations are forcing many players to take action. Companies that invest in state-of-the-art on-site power generation enjoy multiple benefits – by curbing their emissions through the flexible use of available raw materials and also by using technologies that seamlessly integrate into their production systems. We provide you robust mechanical engineering that will operate reliably – even with frequent changes of load and fluctuating gas quality. \nWhether you process recycled fiber or use cellulose and lignin from the raw material wood, your systems will consume large volumes of electricity and heat. Generate your own process steam with an integrated power plant on-site. We offer plants with combined heat and power (CHP) in all scales to meet every need. That means you can remain flexible and independent over the long run. \nMining is all about raw materials. When it comes to competition, it is production costs that matter – and energy costs are a key factor. The remote regions where raw materials are extracted are often not connected to public power networks. An on-site supply requires flexible facilities that can deliver power under tough conditions at low cost. Whether it’s for open-cast or underground mining, in cold or hot environments, as a standalone system or a back-up for renewable sources – we will design and build exactly the power plant solution you need to bolster your competitive position. \nSafety is paramount in chemical processes, and outages are both risky and costly – so your electricity supply must be totally reliable. This works best if you have your own generating system on-site, which will make you independent of external suppliers and curb costs in the long term. If a power plant also permits heat extraction, all the better – that will make your entire system even more efficient. We build the right solution for you – and integrate it seamlessly into your chain of processes. \nThe energy landscape is changing. Small gas-fired power plants will be a mainstay of our energy supply system for the foreseeable future. That’s because they can serve as a flexible back-up for renewables, they’re highly efficient and operate reliably, and they can enable regions to function independently. On islands or at remote industrial sites, covering basic load or peak, with or without heat extraction – our industrial power plant solution will perfectly suit your specific requirements. \nThe SGT-800 is the flagship of the Siemens portfolio of industrial gas turbines and provides excellent performance in combined cycle operation. It has proven itself in grid support and as a reliable backup for renewable energy sources. It is equally well-suited for independently supplying an industrial facility, with or without a grid connection. You can build on a fleet availability of over 97 percent. \nGet even more out of the energy in your fuel: A steam generator will use waste heat from the gas turbine to generate steam, which can drive a steam turbine. Combined cycle operation pays off. \nNew gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability. Hydrogen ready is defined as a prepared pathway towards an x% hydrogen capability.  \nMore than 1,500 power stations are in use around the world. Here are some of our top projects we have implemented with our customers. \nDo you want to supply your facility with power, reliably and cost-effectively? Or free yourself from reliance on a costly public supply? Do you need a flexible reserve power plant? Together we’ll find the perfect solution for your particular challenge. \nContact \nThe page with name \"Industrial power plants\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/industrial-power-plants.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Surge arresters\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/surge-arresters.html\" has the following content:\nContinuous research and development, the wealth of Siemens Energy know-how and comprehensive worldwide experience give Siemens Energy surge arresters a leading edge in overvoltage protection.

The oil and gas industry is beginning a transformation of its own, increasingly looking toward data-driven solutions to boost performance, enhance efficiency and ultimately, to reduce costs. Siemens Energy helps customers optimize the performance of critical oil and gas assets and equipment. We draw on an extensive software portfolio, deep expertise in data analytics and extensive experience in oil and gas and other industries.   \nDigitalization and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand when it comes to protecting assets against cyberattacks.  \nDigital technologies are helping almost every industry rewrite its operating landscape, and the oil and gas industry is catching up. Advancements in technology, the falling cost of digitalization, and the connectivity of smart devices provide a real competition-beating opportunity for oil and gas companies who play the digital revolution right.

By utilizing our highly engineered Artificial Lift technologies like AI4ESP or SIWELL, we are able to efficiently optimize automation for well pumps. \nThink offshore production can be profitable in a cyclical oil and gas market? Aker BP does. And so does Siemens Energy.  \nIn fact, Aker BP's bold publically stated objective is to drive production costs to US$7 per barrel. On the Ivar Aasen Field Development project Siemens worked closely with Aker BP to implement condition monitoring—a data-driven approach to optimizing equipment maintenance schedules, and ultimately, to reducing costs. \n \nInstead of monitoring critical equipment from a North Sea platform, Aker BP personnel monitor it from an onshore control room in Trondheim, Norway, 1,000 km away. A unique process known as time-stamping, as opposed to the more conventional sampling, enhances the accuracy of the acquired machine data, better positioning crews to predict and preempt any maintenance issues. \nThe net result? Fewer personnel working on the remote offshore platform for extended periods, not to mention traveling to and from the jobsite via helicopter, and a significant OPEX savings. \nData-driven remote condition monitoring optimizes offshore maintenance, reduces costs  \nAs the world’s oil and gas industry strives to expand margins by reducing production costs wherever possible, advanced capabilities enabled by the integration and digitalization of upstream operations can help in substantial ways. One prime example is remote condition monitoring of well-site equipment, especially offshore. \nAker BP deployed remote condition monitoring on its offshore platform, built to develop Ivar Aasen field in the Norwegian North Sea, in an effort to reduce OPEX costs, increase regularity and improve operations safety. \nThis technical paper presents Siemens Energy's view on key cybersecurity defensive mechanisms based on the pipeline control and communications systems defense-in-depth approach, focusing on Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) protection measures, sequence of event (SOE) clock synchronization, multi-factor authentication, early-warning cyber intrusion detection and ransomware recovery.

The initial release to market was the TA1250; however, with various up rates throughout the years, the final release product was the TA2500 in 1983. Most of the fleet is the TA1750 with a power output of 1,810 bhp (PG) and 1,875 bhp (MD) at full load speed of 6,000 rev/min (PG) and 6,600 rev/min (MD) under ISO conditions. \nAs the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Siemens Energy Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd. benefits from a global network of expertise and designs, manufacturers, sells and offers service support products for gas turbines and their associated equipment, to suit the specific service requirements of each operator.   \nOur offerings range includes: \nThe TA is a proven unit in service for nearly 70 years for all electrical power generation; mechanical load drives, including compression and pumping for use in both industrial power generation and Oil and Gas sectors. It offers operates on a wide range of gaseous and liquid fuels. \nThere are significant number of units still in service throughout the world, in the widely varying climatic conditions of Alaska, the Americas, Europe, the Middle and Far East. \n        - Significant fleet experience \nGas Generator The axial compressor is ﬂexibly coupled to the compressor turbine and the complete rotating assembly is supported in three bearings. These are carried in the rigid stator casings, which are split horizontally along the centre line of the rotor shaft to facilitate inspection of both the rotor and stator blades and bearings. A single large diameter combustion chamber is used, capable of burning a wide range of fuels. \nCompressor The thirteen-stage compressor is a subsonic aerodynamic design with a pressure ratio of 4:1 at full load. Two sleeve bearings are used to carry the rotating assembly supported by the stator casing at the turbine end and the inlet casing at the compressor end. An anti-whirl type bearing is ﬁtted at the compressor turbine end of the assembly and thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined double acting tilting pad bearing. Separate grooved discs are clamped together with a single through bolt to make up the rotor assembly. Stator blades are retained by dovetail roots in grooves machined on the stator casing which is split on the horizontal centre line to facilitate inspection of the rotor and stator assemblies. \nCompressor Turbine The two-stage turbine which is ﬂexibly coupled to the compressor rotor, has a full load speed of approximately 12,000rev/ min.  \nPower Turbine The discs of the two-stage free power turbine and the rotor blades are manufactured from alloys to meet the engine duty. The blades are ﬁxed into the discs by the traditional ﬁr tree root method and secured by peening. The use of two stages gives low stress levels and maintains a safe overspeed capability. There are no critical speeds within the operating speed range. Two sleeve bearings support the power turbine rotor shaft which are carried in the robust gear casting to which is secured the support arm for the stator casing. Thrust loads are taken by a white metal lined tilting pad thrust bearing. \nControl system The compensating hydraulic governor, that controls the quantity of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber, is gear driven from the power turbine. It controls the turbine over the full power range and allows output speed to be controlled. Starting may be either from a 24-volt D.C. electric motor or by a gas starter motor driving through a Bendix drive on to the turbine axial compressor shaft. When operating on gaseous fuels the pilot igniter can be supplied with gas from the main fuel system via a pressure reducing valve. For engines burning liquid fuel the igniter gas supply is taken from a gas bottle or similar source of supply. The control equipment is housed in two cabinets mounted in the turbine under base, the hydraulic control cabinet housing the engine instruments, pressure switches a servo system component while the electrical control cabinet contains the associated relays, timers, wiring and terminals, the selection switches, the annunciator panel, and the T Max temperature indicator.  \nThe turbine is fitted with devices to shut down the turbine in the event of: \nIn the event of high lubricating oil temperature or high cycle temperature, a visual and audible warning is given before shutdown values are reached \nEngine Auxiliaries During starting and for the cooling period after shutdown, lubricating oil is supplied by a D.C. electric motor-driven auxiliary lubricating oil pump. The main engine pump is driven through the auxiliary gear train from the output shaft. Oil cooling is by either an air blast or water-cooled cooler to meet site requirements. The double helical gears have hardened teeth and are precision ground to ensure silent running and long working life. For direct drive to centrifugal pumps and compressors a shaft speed of 6,600 rev/min is provided. The engine is mounted on an under base with extended platforms on which the auxiliary components are installed. This also forms the lubricating oil tank. \nInspection of the internal components of the TA gas turbine is necessary only when a blade inspection is due, usually after 20,000 to 30,000 hours (3 years) running. The turbine can be rapidly opened for such inspections and can be carried out at site. The turbine rotors are retained by a single through bolt which is quickly removed to permit withdrawal of both compressor and power turbines.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"TA Industrial Gas Turbine\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/ta-industrial-gas-turbine.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Storage solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/storage-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nFor that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically. \nWhile today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.  \nToday, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs. \nBy mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed. \nStoring fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage. \nWhen it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible. \nFor ELEC, everything revolves around the topic of energy. No wonder, after all, he lives in a light bulb. Bursting with questions on the energy transition, he wants to know why storage solutions are so important on our way towards a CO₂-free economy. Watch the video for more. \nWant to see more ELEC episodes and join him on his quest for answers on the energy transition?  \nExplore more \nThe situation energy producers, distributers and industrial consumers find themselves in is by no means easy. They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets. \nAlso, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability.  \nBut a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption. The production of green hydrogen also requires renewable energy sources, but if none are available, energy still needs to be at hand to manufacture it.  \nEnergy storage solves many of these problems: \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later.\n \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later. \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher.\n \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher. \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand.\n \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand. \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators.\n \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators. \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid.\n \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid. \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities.\n \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities. \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power.\n \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power. \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production.\n \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production. \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities.\n \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities. \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units.\n \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units. \nExpertise you can count on \nWe take responsibility for the entire project, from engineering through commissioning, keeping your project on time and on budget.

Therefore, seasonal and multi-day energy shifting is made possible, and limiting power output is avoided. \nWith the share of renewables increasing annually, the energy grid is facing challenges. By providing instant and zero-carbon energy, our storage portfolio allows grid stabilization. \nEnergy storage creates new revenue streams. For example, it allows expansion of the grid by supplying and storing energy for grid stabilization (so-called virtual grid expansion). Likewise, when energy is cheap, it can be stored to sell it when prices are high (so-called energy arbitrage). \nIn this white paper you will find an overview of energy storage systems and how they help us build a decarbonized energy system. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Storage solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/storage-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Coal to Gas\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/brownfield-transformation/coal-to-gas.html\" has the following content:\n75% of global CO₂ emissions in the power generation sector are caused by coal power plants. Converting coal-fired power plants into highly efficient combined cycle plants can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 70%. It also gives you the option to co-fire clean hydrogen in your gas turbine, enabling you to decarbonize your plant operation even further.  \nBased on the Brownfield Transformation concept, our approach includes repurposing as much of your existing infrastructure as possible to enable a fast transition towards a new energy system while reducing CO₂ emissions at the same time.  \nA full repowering entails not just changing the fuel from coal or oil to gas but converting the steam power plant to a highly efficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) by reusing infrastructure, site permits and local personnel. Not only is this approach faster and more sustainable but it also saves up to 30% of Capex compared to building a new power plant. \nThere are two options to repower your plant: the indoor and the outdoor approach. \nWith the indoor approach, you can reuse most of the existing infrastructure such as foundations, connections, housing and piping. This saves time and costs. With the outdoor approach, you can start building in parallel when the existing plant is still running to secure critical supplies. \nIn principle, a \"full repowering\" means that one or more gas turbines with downstream heat recovery steam generators replace the old steam generator previously fired with coal or oil. In order to achieve this, various modifications of the steam cycle are necessary, as well as the exchange and retrofit of various components.  \nFor a full repowering, one needs to make sure that the appropriate gas capacities are available. For the final plan, other factors to be considered are the plant capacity, the heat quantities, and levels to be supplied for district heating and/or process steam applications. Also, one needs to consider the space available, and the condition of the power plant. The overall aim is to keep as much of the existing infrastructure as possible.  \nWhile it is impressive that by converting a conventional coal power plant to a CCPP CO₂ emissions get reduced by up to 70%, it’s worth mentioning that this is a result not just from the fuel switch, but also from an increase in the power plant’s efficiency from an average of 38% to up to 63%. \nA boiler conversion involves a modification of the burner technology and a change of coal or oil to gas. While switching to gas as a fuel does not increase the efficiency of the steam plant, it does reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 50%. \n‘Topping’ requires the installation of a small gas turbine, regardless of whether the fuel is switched from coal to gas or not. The thermal energy contained in the flue gas of the ‘topping’ gas turbine is fed directly to the steam generator of the existing plant. This results in a slight improvement in overall plant efficiency.  \nBoosting requires the installation of an additional – usually medium – gas turbine and a waste heat boiler. In contrast to topping, the heat energy contained in the flue gas of the gas turbine is used with the aid of a heat exchanger to generate high-pressure steam and to preheat the feed water of the existing process. Boosting makes the steam power plant more flexible, while also increasing efficiency and reducing CO₂ emissions. \nParallel repowering utilizes the steam contained in the flue gas of a newly installed large gas turbine with the aid of a heat recovery steam generator for additional feedwater preheating and steam generation in the existing steam power plant process. This conversion also serves to increase the flexibility and efficiency of steam power plants, but to a greater degree than boosting. \nUnderstanding customer’s market environment, the regional energy system and regulatory framework in order to create a customized cost-optimized, efficient, or flexible solution, while aiming at the same time at integrating as many existing assets as possible. \nAnalyzing how to integrate the new equipment – such as gas turbines or generators – fit into the existing plant layout and infrastructure. Especially for indoor solutions, it’s important to analyze how existing foundations, piping and connections can be reused, while ensuring the new setup will work smoothly and safely.  \nIdentifying the best configuration with the best thermodynamic fit in order to match the future operating regime with the intended business model.

But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically. \nWhile today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.  \nToday, in a variety of cases, battery storage is being used as an efficient method of supplying power when needed. For example, many large offshore vessels or drilling platforms use it for their electricity needs. In power plants, together with mechanical flywheels, batteries are being used for ensuring grid stability, to perform ‘black starts’ (without external power sources) if needed, and support frequency regulation. They are also directly connected to the grid as stand-alone solutions to help with fluctuating power supply and demand. And combining renewables – such as wind farms – with battery storage can successfully manage power depending on current needs. \nBy mid-century, we envision a nearly completely decarbonized world with power produced from renewable sources only, resulting in efficient power consumption across society, intelligent management of a decentralized power grid, and the wide use of different energy storage technologies. Batteries will be used for short-term storage of electricity, and, for mid-term storage, combinations of thermal and mechanical storage solutions will provide industrial heat and electricity. Also, electrolyzers will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other sectors of the economy as needed. \nStoring fluctuating electricity supply is vital to stabilize the grid in the face of growing renewables build-out. Join us to discuss and evaluate the project economics of various technology types for integrated energy storage, and the possibility of sector coupling via H2 energy storage. \nWhen it comes to our energy future, nothing will work without energy storage. That’s why the massive and rapid rollout of energy storage solutions is essential to stabilise the grid, decarbonise power generation, secure energy supply and make sector coupling possible. \nFor ELEC, everything revolves around the topic of energy. No wonder, after all, he lives in a light bulb. Bursting with questions on the energy transition, he wants to know why storage solutions are so important on our way towards a CO₂-free economy. Watch the video for more. \nWant to see more ELEC episodes and join him on his quest for answers on the energy transition?  \nExplore more \nThe situation energy producers, distributers and industrial consumers find themselves in is by no means easy. They face constant social pressure to decarbonize – and risk ruining their reputation if they appear not to act fast enough. As long as they emit CO2, they have to pay a hefty price for it. Once energy utilities close fossil-fired power plants, they have to manage stranded assets. \nAlso, renewable energy producers have to ensure a consistent availability of energy – and in order to do so, they may have to curtail output. And as the share of renewable energy increases year over year, operators are challenged to cost-efficiently match energy supply and demand and ensure grid stability.  \nBut a steady flow of energy is non-negotiable: Industry, like many other sectors of the economy, relies on it in order to ensure its operations run smoothly and without interruption. The production of green hydrogen also requires renewable energy sources, but if none are available, energy still needs to be at hand to manufacture it.  \nEnergy storage solves many of these problems: \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later.\n \nIf you have a surplus in energy production, energy storage solutions can save it for later. \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher.\n \nStored energy can be sold when energy prices are higher. \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand.\n \nStorage solutions help balancing energy supply and demand. \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators.\n \nOn-site batteries enable black-start capabilities often required by regulators. \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid.\n \nWith the share of renewables increasing, energy storage helps to stabilize the grid. \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities.\n \nStorage solutions expand conventional power plants or turn them into energy storage facilities. \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power.\n \nAvoiding operational downtime and penalties for non-available service by using energy storage as back-up power. \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production.\n \nStored renewable energy helps avoiding CO2 prices associated with fossil energy production. \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities.\n \nWith the help of smart digital tools, you can get the most out of storage facilities. \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units.\n \nEnergy storage solutions can be part of an efficient network of power generating units. \nExpertise you can count on \nWe take responsibility for the entire project, from engineering through commissioning, keeping your project on time and on budget.

There are numerous complementary methods for diagnosing the transformer ageing process early and reliably. The Siemens Energy Test Laboratory for Transformer Materials is completely focused on the laboratory diagnostics of oil-filled electrical equipment. The highly qualified personnel are constantly developing new methods for ageing diagnostics and are using this knowledge for the benefit of our customers. \nAccredited as an independent test laboratory in accordance with ISO 17025 (Certificate) \nOur services include insulating oil analyses and material testing. The diagnostic test procedures vary between ageing analysis or condition detection of oils /insulating materials and the new state assessments of oils /insulating materials. \nThe lifespan of a transformer largely depends on the ageing of the solid and liquid organic insulating materials. In normal operating conditions, below the maximum permissible load, and with regular maintenance and care, a transformer's lifespan can be extended to well over 30 years. \nNevertheless, during the working life of a transformer abnormal events could occur, for example transient over voltages, overheating during emergency operation, dynamic stress and faults in the cooling. These processes result in an accelerated ageing of the transformer materials. \nWhether it is a case of new construction, operation, retrofit or repair, it is always a matter of reliably recognizing material degradation and rectifying it. For this purpose an extensive knowledge of the materials as well as a specific, precise analysis is fundamental. In order to avoid costly breakdowns, minimize downtimes and extend the lifespan of a transformer, the performance of a regular trend analysis and targeted maintenance are indispensable. \nThe combination of moisture in the oil and in the cellulose is an indicator of ageing. The most important method for the diagnosis of the ageing process as a result of dielectric, thermal, dynamic and chemical ageing in oil and oil-paper insulation is the Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). The Siemens Energy Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers a comprehensive service, from the collection of samples to analysis and assessment. \nThe sampling device, developed in collaboration with the customers, offers the following advantages: \nDuring the mostly decades-long service life of a transformer, materials too are subjected to considerable ageing processes. Through our tests we are able to determine the condition of the materials, and offer our clients the possibility to plan any necessary maintenance measures early. \nAnalyses of solid insulating materials, conductive metallic materials (grain-oriented electrical steel and copper materials) as well as coating materials and sealing materials, are carried out.  \nDuring the natural aging process of the oil and insulating parts, especially in the case of thermal or electrical failures, cracked gases form, and are dissolved in the oil. The rate of decomposition and the type of gases change during defective operation, which could be a result of thermal overloading and/or electrical faults. Based on the quantity or type of fault gases, the gas increase rates and the proportions between the gases, the type of failure can be deduced. \nPartial discharges with lower energy mainly lead to the formation of hydrogen and methane, as well as small quantities of ethane. Thermal overheating results in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. In temperatures between 300-700°C ethylene and propylene accompanied by larger quantities of CO and CO2 prevail. Over 700°C mainly ethylene, propylene and hydrogen form, and above 1000°C acetylene are also formed. Electrical discharges (arcs and spark discharges) cause separation of hydrogen and acetylene, as well as methane and ethylene. By thermal-oxidative cellulose degradation, larger quantities of CO and CO2 are formed. \nThrough DGA mainly slowly developing faults can be detected. The gradual development of gas concentration allows for a trend analysis, which in turn makes it possible to make a prognosis on the lifespan of the transformer. The following failure sources can also be understood by means of DGA: \n The following cannot be detected by means of DGA:  \nThe maintenance of insulating liquids is based on IEC norm, VDE 0370 part 2 (= IEC 60422). This norm is valid for oils that are already contained in transformers. For new oil the norm VDE 0370 part 1 (= IEC 60296) is valid. \nThe following oil values are decisive for the regulation of measures: \nThe color and appearance of transformer oil are useful for comparative evaluation: a quick color darkening or dark oil is a sign of oil ageing. The analyzed oil color is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 8, whereby the level of discoloration is indicated by means of the rising color number.  \nBy analyzing the appearance, undesirable by-products can be detected. Cloudiness or sediment indicate free water, insoluble sludge or dirt particles. If these are present, then also the breakdown voltage and/or the loss factor and eventually also other oil values are out of the norm and measures must be taken. \nThe breakdown voltage (Ud) indicates how well insulating oil can withstand an electrical load and is therefore decisive for the operational efficiency of a transformer. The breakdown voltage is measured according to VDE 0370 part 5 (=IEC 60156). The initial measures to be taken in case of a drop below the insulation voltage limit values of the relative transformer type, depend on the values of the other characteristic oil values. \nWater formation is caused by the ageing of cellulose- insulating material (paper, pressboard, laminated wood), ageing of oil and infiltration of humidity from the environment by means of badly maintained air dryers and/or defective sealing systems. \nThere is an equilibrium between the water content in oil and the moisture content in the solid insulation, it reduces the breakdown voltage and accelerates the ageing process. This equilibrium though, is temperature and time-dependent. \nAs there is never an even temperature in an operating transformer, -oil temperature in the tank is much higher at the top than at the bottom, and the same counts for the temperature distribution in the windings – the moisture distribution curves are only a rough estimate. In the moisture distribution curves the water content in the oil can theoretically be distinguished from the moisture content in the cellulose, based on the temperature. This is however valid only for insulation paper and not for pressboard and laminated wood.  A precondition is constant temperature and a set equilibrium. \nThrough progressive ageing (Oxidation) of the oil, polar decomposition products develop. These deteriorate the dielectric properties of the oil. The result of far advanced oil ageing is sludge formation. Sludge greatly compromises the windings because it leads to the formation of sediments, which prevent heat removal. This heat accumulation in turn causes the winding paper to age intensely. A timely diagnosis of the incipient acid formation is therefore important, so that timely counteractive measures can be initiated. \nLiterature: Cigre Brochure D1.30 – „Oxidation Stability of Insulating Fluids“ \nThe dielectric dissipation factor of an insulating material is the tangent of the dielectric loss angle. \nThe dielectric loss angle, is the angle in which the phase difference between the applied voltage and consequential current diverges from π/2 rad, when the capacitor's dielectric comprises only of insulating material. \nA rising dissipation factor is an indication of oil ageing or oil contamination. The dissipation factor is strongly influenced by polar components and is therefore a very sensitive parameter. \nIn addition to the neutralization value and the dissipation factor, interfacial tension is another indicator of sludge formation in the transformer. This test measures the concentration of polar molecules in oil, which form during the ageing process. The higher the concentration, the lower the interfacial tension and the likelier it is for the insulating oil to form sludge. \nInhibitors are age protecting agents which delay the decomposition of the insulating oil. The IEC 60296 accredited inhibitor DBPC (Di-tertiary-butyl-para-cresol), with a weight percentage of 0.25 ± 0.040 , is used. Inhibited oils are preferred for transformers > 200 MVA, for heavily loaded transformers such as traction transformers, for oven transformers or at special customer request. When the accelerated oil ageing process is caused by a transformer malfunction, the original inhibitor content (0,3), can be restored by adding a calculated amount of DBPC in powder form, once the failure has been fixed. Even in the case of normal DBPC- deterioration, the oil can be re-inhibited, although an oil change would be less expensive. This decision can be made only based on the results of the other oil value tests: if these are normal then a re-inhibition can be successful. The inhibitor content is determined using infrared spectrometry or gas chromatography with MS-detector. \nThe decomposition of paper is caused by the processes of hydrolysis, pyrolysis and oxidation. The degree of polymerization (DP-value) of paper was defined by IEC 60450 and it counts the number of polymerized glucose rings. During the paper decomposition, the DP-value is reduced and the tensile strength decreases. New cellulose has a DP-value of 1000-1100, aged cellulose on the other hand has a value of only 150-200, which means the end of the transformer's lifespan. \nAs it is not possible to take paper samples during running operation, the condition of the solid insulation is estimated based on the cellulose decomposition products (2- Furfural). For this purpose a regular trend analysis is necessary. \nThe furan content in oil depends on: \nAn exact link between the furan content and DP-value cannot be deduced at present. However it is possible to make a trend analysis: based on the change of the furan content, information about thermal conduct of the solid insulation over the years can be obtained. \nThe testing and approval of new insulating liquids, or mineral oils, synthetic or natural ester or silicone liquids is also part of the laboratory's work. \nUsing our computer controlled and monitored oxidation equipment we are able to set and monitor the test conditions much more precisely than is required by the standard specifications. The result is a much better reproducibility and safe assessment. \nThe solid insulating materials in the windings include purified cellulose solid materials like pressboard and insulating paper as well as bonded laminates (e.g. laminated board, various fiber- reinforced synthetic materials). \nIn the material testing laboratory the physical properties of these materials are tested, hence verifying their applicability for transformer construction. \nThe following tests are carried out: \nTransformer cores are made up of grain-oriented electrical steel. There are three different qualities: conventional grain-oriented steel, highly permeable grain-oriented steel and domain refined electrical steel. \nIn the material testing laboratory the following tests are carried out on the grain-oriented electrical steel: \nCopper materials are mainly used in the windings and in the leads as single flat conductors, multiple flat conductors and continuously transposed conductors. The condition of the enamel paint and of the paper wrapping is decisive for safe transformer operation. \nThe following tests are carried out on copper materials: \nThe tank, tank cover, manhole cover and valves of a transformer are sealed using sealing materials that are resistant to insulating liquid, for example: \nOutside coating materials are used as corrosion protection for tanks, radiators, coolers and other construction parts. Interior coatings on the other hand are used to protect the transformer from possible metal particle contamination. \nThe main coating materials used are environmentally friendly. These can be for example, water-based, “High Solid” or cathodic dip coating. \nIn the material testing laboratory we inspect the condition of the coating using the following procedures: \nAdhesives, cast resins, desiccants, glide waves and detergents are only some of the numerous auxiliary materials used in transformer production or repair. The behavior of each of these auxiliary materials must be understood to the smallest detail, particularly in their interaction with other materials. We therefore test the adhesion of glues, the adsorption behavior of desiccants and the compatibility of different auxiliary materials with insulating liquids. \nSiemens Energy Transformers Chemical-physical material testing laboratory Katzwanger Str. 150 90461 Nürnberg, Germany E-Mail: testlab.energy@siemens-energy.com   \nCustomer Support Phone: +49 911 6505 6505 E-Mail: support@siemens-energy.com \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Test Laboratory for Transformer Materials\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/test-laboratory-for-transformer-materials.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"FPSO Production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/oil-gas/fpso-oil-gas.html\" has the following content:\nOptimizing the lifecycle performance of floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels is highly contingent on the incorporation of topsides packages that can efficiently and reliably deliver the power to exploit resources in a range of water depths and operating conditions.

The combination of proven gas turbine and ORC technology for efficient recovery of waste heat is our response to the market challenges which various regions of the world are facing today. One billion people do not have any access to electricity, and another billion have a lack of reliable power supply; especially ones that are located in remote and isolated areas. Offering affordable electricity while taking the environment with water-free operation into account can be achieved with a reliable Heat ReCycle power plant solution. \nHeat ReCycle allows for remote areas to be provided with highly efficient and reliable power generation.

The thermal energy in the hot exhaust gas is recovered through a Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU), using an organic fluid as the heat exchange medium. The hot organic fluid is used to power an ORC-turbine and generator to generate additional electricity. This combined cycle characterizes itself with simplicity compared to a water-/steam-cycle, at the same time completely eliminating the need for water at all. \nThe Organic Rankine Cycle's principle is based on a turbogenerator working as a conventional steam turbine to transform thermal energy into mechanical energy and finally into electrical energy through an electrical generator. Instead of generating steam from water, the ORC system vaporizes an organic fluid, characterized by a molecular mass higher than that of water, which leads to a slower rotation of the turbine, lower pressures and no erosion of the metal parts and blades. \nThe Heat ReCycle range of power plants provides a wide choice of different industrial and aeroderivative gas turbines. The power plant can be customized for the required project-specific boundaries, such as power output and operating load regime. Heat ReCycle power plant configurations are possible from roughly 10 to almost 100 MWe capacity. \nThe 3 x SGT-400 Heat ReCycle reference configuration is used as an example for explaining this new power plant in further detail. Having a three-on-one (3 gas turbines on 1 ORC turbine) configuration in the typical 50-MW capacity size range enables operational flexibility. Especially for remote locations, the 50-MW size range has traditionally been served by reciprocating engines or simple cycle gas turbines. Now, Heat ReCycle offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative, while providing a great deal of flexibility through this multi-unit set-up.  \nThe total power plant output of this configuration is in the range of roughly 52 - 58 MW, depending on the GT version and project conditions. See more plant details in the below table: \nThe Heat ReCycle 3 x SGT-400 configuration provides flexible, reliable and affordable power while complying with the most stringent emissions standards globally. The multi-unit set-up allows for a great deal of flexibility and plant part load capability while also reaching high efficiencies with the ORC bottoming-cycle. This 50 MW-range power plant is unique in its kind and is competitive against reciprocating engines in the same power range. The benefits include a very high power-density, attractive CAPEX, and better LCoE than similar power solutions for intermediate to base load power generation. \nThe SGT-400 is a simple, robust twin-shaft gas turbine, suitable for all climates and serves a power band of 10 – 15 MW. The SGT-400 is a leader in operational and fuel flexibility, low emissions, and overall efficiency. A wide range of fuel compositions can be burned while running efficiently at all loads. The turbine can meet stringent emission standards while operating as low as 30% load, and has seamless, true dual-fuel capability. With more than 390 units installed all over the globe and more than 5 million actual operating hours, it is an excellent fit to the Heat ReCycle power plant.  \nThe Waste Heat Recovery Unit (WHRU) offers an efficient method of recovering thermal energy from the waste heat of gas turbine exhaust gases. Unlike a traditional Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), the WHRU is a single stage system using a once-through principle and is therefore less complex. The WHRU has been completely optimized around the gas turbine and is charaterized by its highly modular design for optimal constructability. The complete WHRU can be installed in less than 6 weeks and offers the lowest total installed cost. \nFor more information on Heat ReCycle power plant solutions, please get in touch with our experts. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Heat ReCycle solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/heat-recycle-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Benson technology\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/benson-technology.html\" has the following content:\nBenson technology is a proven process for large-scale steam generation in power plants. The heart of this process is the once-through principle. Combined with sliding pressure operation, this allows for highly efficient, flexible, and reliable power plant operation. Our Benson technology and our associated Benson license will improve your specific steam generator and, consequently, benefit your power plant performance. Find out more below or contact us.  \nA new Benson HP evaporator design for vertical-exhaust-gas-flow heat recovery steam generators – deployed for the first time in the 24 HRSGs of the Siemens Energy H-class Egypt Megaproject – has proved highly successful. Commissioning and operation have been trouble free, thanks to innovative design features and simulation-based prior optimisation of the all-important Benson-specific feed-water controller.  \nSince 1933 leading steam generator manufacturers have constructed Benson steam generators worldwide under Siemens Energy Benson license. Today, our Benson technology is widely used in fired steam generators and heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) of highly efficient modern power plants. \nToday combined cycle gas power plants need to be more efficient and flexible than ever, because they have to both \nThis is where Benson HRSGs make an important contribution. The unique once-through design enables fast flexible start up of a combined cycle, while maintaining high cycle efficiency. Benson HRSGs can be constructed either horizontally or vertically and will fit into any power plant architecture.   \nBenefits compared with drum-type steam generators \nThe first combined cycle power plant with a Benson heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) – the 390-MW Cottam CDC, located in Great Britain – was successfully commissioned in 1999. More than 100 Benson heat-recovery steam generators have been commissioned to date or are currently under construction. \nThe overall efficiency of a steam power plant counts in every respect, whether it’s reducing emissions or increasing economic efficiency. The best way to boost efficiency is by selecting high steam parameters. The once-through principle permits steam generation even at supercritical pressure. To date Benson boilers have been built for pressures up to 310 bar. \nContribution to flexible power plant operation \nThe Benson steam generator is especially well suited to flexible sliding-pressure operation: A steam power plant with a Benson steam generator can sustain load transients of four to six percent per minute over a wide power output range. High plant efficiency is ensured even at part load. \nSophisticated construction ­– individually optimized \nBenson steam generators can be precisely adapted to suit your firing conditions: Different furnace sizes and geometries can be used depending on the fuel used. An important factor here is that the functions on the water/steam side are not restricted. Benson steam generators have been constructed with the broadest possible range of firing systems, including fluidized bed combustion. \nLately, the Benson steam generator with vertical rifled tubes has been successfully established in the market. Based on the Benson Low Mass Flux Design, this type of steam generator combines outstanding operating characteristics with low investment costs and high levels of reliability. \nMore than 1,300 Benson fired steam generators have been commissioned to date. \nBenson steam generators have outstanding operating characteristics and are extremely reliable – thanks to continuous research and development. And we are refining the technology even more: We’re working intensively to optimize the heat transfer, pressure drop, and flow stability of two phase flows in evaporator tubes. Siemens Energy has its own Benson test rig for the trials. The results of the trials have led to the creation of the world’s largest database on heat transfer and pressure drop in evaporator tubes, and support the development and validation of the Siemens Eenrgy Benson design software. \nAnother key area of focus is the development of Benson-specific control concepts, which make a key contribution to ensuring the best possible operation of your particular system. \nIn 1925, Siemens acquired the right to use Benson's patent, and in 1926–27 the first large Benson boiler in Berlin-Gartenfeld was built. Siemens improved the technology and developed it as an internationally acknowledged standard for large steam generators. In 1933, Siemens decided that it would no longer manufacture steam generators in its facilities, but would instead award licenses based on its own patents and expertise. This story goes still further: \nThe Siemens Energy Benson license is available for fired steam generators as well as for heat-recovery steam generators. It primarily addresses the thermodynamic and thermo-hydraulic design of the evaporator system in Benson steam generators.  \nBasically, the license comprises the following components: \nIn addition to providing the Benson license, we also advise utilities on questions related to the evaporator system of once-through steam generators. \nThis is where you can find downloads to the services we offer. \n24 vertical triple-pressure Benson heat-recovery steam generatorsPart of the megaproject designed to increase electricity generation in Egypt by 50 percentHighly efficient and flexible combined cycle operation \nSecond follow-up order from customer for a highly flexible system from SiemensTwo horizontal Benson HRSGs for the multi-shaft system guarantee a high level of flexibility in operationOffsets fluctuations in feed-in from renewables \nTwo horizontal Benson heat-recovery steam generatorsFollowing units 1, 2 and 3, the fourth combined cycle power plant Dangjin 4 supplies more than 900 MWEco-friendly electricity to more than 900,000 people \nGive your steam generator a boost.

Our engineered expertise is unrivaled in meeting the ever changing needs of EPCs and Owner Operators who are now rethinking how to manage the entire life-cycle of their assets. Siemens Energy has developed Topsides 4.0 - a comprehensive digital life-cycle approach designed to help offshore operators harness the full power of digital transformation for rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, and automation systems. This all starts with digitally configuring solutions jointly with our clients during the conceptual and design phases of their projects, progresses through manufacturing to virtual testing. All delivering an intelligent digital twin of the topsides facility for life cycle decision support and asset optimization. This effectively enables our clients to maximize the performance of critical equipment, and do end-to-end asset optimization. \nTopsides 4.0 is a digital lifecycle approach to rotating equipment and electrical and automation systems that begins during the conceptual and design phase of a project with the development of a comprehensive digital roadmap. It is during this time that we evaluate how the operator is using data, where the gaps are, and how to best fill them. With that knowledge, Siemens Energy collaborates with the operator and tailors a solution to meet their specific needs. \nTopsides 4.0 is designed to help offshore operators realize the full potential of Industry 4.0 and overcome the risks that are inherent in offshore projects by reducing capital and operating costs and shortening facility development cycles. This is achieved through digital project management and manufacturing, virtual testing and commissioning, and delivery of an intelligent “Digital Twin” of the topsides facility, which can be used by operators for decision-making support and asset optimization. \nDigital solutions have long been applied in other industries to improve efficiency and productivity. The oil and gas industry, however, is just starting to begin its digital transformation. In offshore oil and gas production, many operators are beginning to discover the massive potential digitalization has to offer. \nThe foundation of Topsides 4.0 is the workflow and data integration of solutions that Siemens Energy has successfully delivered to the oil and gas industry over many years. Although the integrated approach is new, the digital solutions that comprise it have a proven track record of success. \nIntegral to the Topsides 4.0 approach is the creation of an intelligent digital twin, which is constructed in parallel to the physical topsides during the design and build phases of the project. The digital twin’s intelligence derives from the capability to interpret raw data through a variety of analytics, some of which are automated and others that are offered as an OEM service. The automated analytics are independent of an equipment vendor and based on statistical analysis of real-time data from the instrumentation and automation system.  For critical equipment, such as compressors and turbines, this layer of monitoring can be supplemented with OEM-connected services for predictive diagnostics, spare parts management, and outage planning. \nThe digital twin is more than a design tool; it’s more than a punch list of parts to fabricate, and it’s more than the 3D model. It’s the joining of the physical and digital worlds as the asset moves through the three phases of a project: FEED and design, configure and build, operate and maintain.  \nCOMOS Walkinside allows operators to create a series of real-life scenarios in which employees can literally see and experience the tasks they will be required to perform. They can virtually look around, listen, practice, and learn operational procedures at zero financial or physical risk to themselves or the operator. For example, maintenance personnel can view where equipment is located, if it is accessible from the floor, or if scaffolding or a crane is necessary, all in a 3D digital space. Using the link with the COMOS platform, they can directly access equipment characteristics, maintenance history, and documentation by clicking through on the equipment in the 3D view. \nThe use of a single engineering data hub is a key enabler for digitalization and Topsides 4.0. With appropriate IT security measures, engineering and maintenance contractors, equipment and other providers can all share the as-built and as-maintained data image of the plant. Instead of delivering and attempting to maintain hard copy documentation, the different stakeholders deliver and update their MRB as data records, which simplifies and expedites the process substantially. This creates complete transparency of information for each plant object and ultimately optimizes the design process. \nThe digital revolution has led to significant performance improvements for producers who are harnessing data-driven solutions; however, despite the largely positive developments, connecting critical equipment to cloud-based platforms does mean that the oil and gas industry must be prepared to respond to an evolving security landscape in which cyber threats are the norm. This is particularly critical when extending the operation of the platform to an onshore location, as is the case with Topsides 4.0. \nA key differentiator of Topsides 4.0 is that all electrical, instrumentation, control, and telecommunications (EICT) systems and equipment are integrated into one cybersecure solution. The EICT design establishes a resilient, reliable, and scalable system backbone and architecture to enable safe operation of the topsides facility from an onshore control center.  \nThe SGT-750 delivers lowest total cost of ownership by reducing fuel costs, maintenance operations and outages. With best-in-class performance, a compact, lightweight design, and the lowest carbon footprint and emissions in the market, with single digit NOx over a wide load range. \nSiemens solutions provide data continuity from early phase concept to end of operational life.

Today’s operators face additional challenges such as: energy transition, effectively managing large amounts of data, cybersecurity threats and tightening legislation. \nOur solutions are tailored to meet the evolving needs of operators globally, taking an integrated approach to the engineering, supply and life cycle optimization of equipment at the heart of midstream assets. We provide complete rotating machinery train solutions, integrated electrical and controls equipment and digital solutions, as well as a comprehensive range of services for support over the entire lifecycle. We are a partner for your energy transition journey, offering a variety of strategies and solutions to reach net zero goals, including integration of energy storage solutions, the production and transportation of hydrogen, and the integration of CO2 capture and compression technologies. \nNatural gas production, processing, transportation and distribution are responsible for a significant proportion of fugitive methane emissions worldwide. Minimizing fugitive methane is critical for reducing its impact on the environment as a potent Green House Gas (GHG). \nIn recent years, oil and gas operators across the supply chain have faced increased pressure to improve efficiency and minimize environmental impacts. To help meet these challenges, the SGT-750 industrial gas turbine has been frequently selected for power generation and mechanical drive applications. Designed to incorporate the size and weight advantages of an aeroderivative gas turbine, the SGT-750 maintains the robustness and flexibility of heavy-duty models. With industry leading fuel-efficiency, single digit emissions down to low part load operation, 68,000 operating hours to a first major overhaul and a service plan with only 17 maintenance days in 17 years, the turbine has become a popular option in oil and gas applications.  \nThe Pipestone Processing Facility, owned by Keyera Partnership, is lowering its carbon footprint with the use of high-efficiency centrifugal compressors and a 40-megawatt industrial gas turbine. The facility, located in Alberta, Canada, also utilizes a refrigeration train that consists of an electric motor-driven DATUM compressor with a variable frequency drive. The project is the first application of the SGT-750 for a gas processing plant in North America. The turbine can achieve single-digit NOₓ emission levels down to a 20% load and the compression train includes a waste heat recovery unit. These factors will enhance processing efficiency and further contribute to reducing the plant’s carbon footprint.   \nMexican midstream operator Fermaca uses three pipeline compressor trains driven by SGT-750 gas turbines to transport natural gas at its El Encino compression station. As an important bridge fuel for the energy transition, the pipeline will transport natural gas from Waha, Texas, to power plants and industrial parks in Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango, as well as to central and western Mexico. This project marks the first installation where an SGT-750 is being used as a mechanical drive unit coupled with our high efficiency pipeline compressors.  \nOur extensive experience in supporting midstream applications all over the world is a testament to the technical capabilities of our equipment, as well as our ability to ensure smooth, on-time delivery and execution. The high efficiency of our compressors, coupled with the low-emissions profile and industry-leading fuel efficiencies of our gas turbines enable midstream operators to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and achieve a lower carbon footprint. \nThorbjörn Fors \nSiemens Energy \nRotating Machinery Trains for Gas Compression \nWe provide fully integrated gas turbine and electric motor driven compression trains for midstream applications including natural gas transmission in pipelines and gas storage.

Our devices allow you to monitor the contact wear, condition and function of your switchgear while protecting against switching overvoltages. \nUsing accessories for Siemens Energy high-voltage circuit breakers can help reduce the life cycle costs of your substation and increase the service life of your equipment. All of these products have been developed and tested for Siemens Energy breakers. \nThe PSD control unit reduces overvoltages and protects electrical equipment. \nEnergizing and re-energizing during an autoreclosing operation of shunt compensated transmission lines cause switching overvoltages on the transmission lines. The design is based on more than 10 years of experiences with controlled switching. This includes applications such as capacitor bank and reactor switching, energizing of transformers and uncompensated transmission lines up to 1100 kV. \nThe SiCEA01 contact erosion analyzer is used to determine the extent of wear to the circuit breaker contacts. The breaking currents of the circuit breaker are used to determine the contact wear.  \nSwitching operations with currents below the rated normal current are evaluated with the rated normal current. \nThe contact burn off is calculated using the integral of the circuit breaker breaking currents. The result is compared with the configured reference values. If the result of this comparison exceeds the warning or alarm value, the corresponding signal contact is activated, and the signal light on the contact wear analysis device shows the status. With this warning or alarm, SiCEA01 shows whether the circuit breaker contact system has already been worn down to a specific level, which allows servicing work to be scheduled in good time. \nYou can find details on our circuit breaker accessories and information about our services here. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Circuit breaker accessories\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/accessories.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Power Plants\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/power-plants.html\" has the following content:\nAs energy consumption will continue to increase in the years to come, efficient power generation will be a vital component to reliable, eco-friendly energy systems. Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.        \nOur ideas grow from experience: In 1866, Werner von Siemens developed the first electric generator, and Siemens Energy built the first power plant in 1885. This spirit of invention is what has driven our power business ever since. Since 1990, we`ve brought more than a hundred turnkey power plants online, supplying hundreds of GW of electricity. Each of them has been constructed with customized solutions to meet our customers’ individual challenges. In other words, we’ve always been involved in supplying electricity to industries, regions, and people all over the world. That’s our purpose. Let’s make tomorrow different today! \nWe have the most extensive in-house technology portfolio on the market, which allows us to choose the most appropriate products to incorporate into your solution. That  allows you to benefit from our expertise as an OEM EPC and from the certainty of one-stop procurement – for every one of your projects. \nSustainability for your power plant project: EHS measures minimize the risks \nHealth and safety are our top priority – for our own employees and those of our suppliers and partners. That’s why we work with management plans and assessments, and that’s why we train and test everyone involved. We regularly visit sites and evaluate the commitment of each individual participant, whether they’re in the office or at the construction site – with one clear goal: to keep people safe from harm. Our EHS (environment, health, and safety) measures significantly cut accident rates and downtime. And in the end, they pay off for your project: with a positive transfer of knowledge to your local team, faster completion, reduced non-conformance-costs (NCCs), and a good reputation. \nLowering CO₂ by using hydrogen for power generation \nNew gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability.  However, today’s new power plants will typically start operating with natural gas for several years. \nIt is therefore crucial to build new natural gas fired power plants that can easily be upgraded and converted to hydrogen operations as hydrogen becomes available to the operator. By doing so, natural gas fired power plants are future-proof and will be fit to meet the amount of hydrogen for which it has been made ready, with minimal conversion costs. \nYou can choose between different scopes of supply – from core turbine only, gas turbine packages up to complete gas-fired power plants. \nPackage \nPower island \nPower core \nTurnkey power plant \nMore than 1,500 Siemens Energy power plants are in operation around the world.

Pressurized air-cooled generators are replacing indirectly hydrogen-cooled machines to significantly reduce plant complexity. They achieve efficiency and power levels comparable to indirectly hydrogen-cooled generators with ratings of up to 560 MVA. Pressurized air-cooled generators are used in simple cycle, combined cycle, and steam power plants, as well as in synchronous condensing applications. \nCombining GVPI stators with water cooling technology enables uniform temperatures and low stress levels to enhance operational flexibility. The proven reliability is greater than 99.9% for more than 1,700 stator windings between 10 and 22 kV with an output of up to 650 MVA. Our fleet leader has over 150,000 operating hours and 3,320 start/stop cycles. \nModern grids require high operational flexibility because of the increased integration of renewable energy sources. Our design supports high ramp-up/down rates and frequent start/stop cycles while keeping thermal mechanical stress in the stator windings low. \nOur proven MICALASTIC® insulation system and Global Vacuum Pressure Impregnation (GVPI) technology ensure maximum electrical endurance and outstanding availability.   \nThe absence of hydrogen gas reduces the complexity of auxiliaries as well as the cost of service and operation. There is no need for hazardous operational areas around the generator. Arriving almost fully assembled, the generator is designed for easy on-site installation and includes many provisions for accessible maintenance.  \nOur generators maintain a high level of common parts across the portfolio (e.g. stator core assembly and rotor). The part and component re-use improves the availability of spare parts and increases the quality in manufacturing and assembling components from our suppliers, at our factory, as well as on site. \nThe SGen-2000P generator offers an innovative mix of verified design features in operating ranges typically reserved for hydrogen-cooled generators. The water-cooled stator and air pressurization system allow this series of generators to operate within an extended performance range and with maximum load-shift flexibility. \nDepending on load demand, the generator is automatically pressurized up to 1 bar (gauge) to control rotor temperature within industry standards. \nWater-cooled stator bars minimize thermal-mechanical stresses in the end winding allowing for unlimited operational flexibility across the design power range. \nThe SGen-2000P implements technology featuring the latest verified design with more than 1,700 GVPI stators in operation across all operating ranges and a fleet-leading water-cooled GVPI stator with over 151,000 hours of operation and more than 3,320 start/stop cycles with no indication of thermal-mechanical stress-related issues. Without the application of hydrogen, the SGen-2000P series offers you the added benefit of unstaffed operation, e.g. for synchronous condenser applications. \nOur patented MICALASTIC® insulation system using GVPI is highly resistant to mechanical and thermal stresses while featuring excellent electrical properties. \nOur patent-pending load-dependent air pressurization system enables rotor cooling during flexible operating conditions. \nThe SGen-2000P generator series was designed for simplified service and maintenance. Along with eliminating hydrogen-related generator auxiliaries, various service-friendly design solutions have been implemented. Its components have been tried and tested over decades of operation, achieving a reliability rate of more than 99.9%. To minimize downtime, the maintenance intervals have been aligned with those of the prime mover and now allow for longer intervals between servicing than ever before. The rotor is designed for lifetime operation without removal for service. \nOur generators arrive on site almost fully assembled with the rotor installed – a design feature that simplifies the installation process. Our certified engineers have extensive experience in commissioning and help you to achieve faster start-up times and smooth operation. The SGen-2000P is designed for easy access. The many manholes installed allow for the majority of maintenance to be completed requiring very little generator disassembly. \nBesides standard inspection scopes and intervals, you also have the option of implementing a condition-based maintenance plan using customized installed instrumentation, component analytics, and a remaining life counter for better predictions. Based on advanced data analytics performed by experts in our network of power diagnostics centers, we can advise you on a maintenance schedule according to your specific operation conditions and needs. \nOur reliable and robust generator is the result of our manufacturing and engineering design teams working in close collaboration throughout its development. By applying the latest digital technologies, our manufacturing facilities stepped up to create a world-class product for you with excellent lead times. \nOur SGen-2000P generator design focuses on the strengths of our manufacturing facilities using tried-and-tested manufacturing processes and newly co-developed processes to efficiently build generators for you. \nOur manufacturing facilities implement as many automated processes as possible, resulting in a high ratio of repetition in the construction of our generators. Automated processes are key to building high-quality, robust generators that operate reliably for you. \nOur SGen-2000P series combines two proven technologies in one innovative concept. The generator operates with air up to 560 MVA and features variable pressurization with water-cooled stator windings. This enables the flexible operation demanded by today's evolving electrical grids. By eliminating hydrogen gas auxiliary systems, the SGen-2000P series' operating and maintenance costs are lower than those of traditional hydrogen-cooled products in this output class. \nDirectly water-cooled stator bars protect against thermal-mechanical stress-related issues that are challenging for indirectly cooled coils in a highly cyclic environment. \nThe SGen-2000P eliminates all hydrogen-related systems – seal oil, hydrogen and inert gas systems – maintaining only a pressurized air skid and a stator water system. Thereby, the hazardous system requirements that applied to the use of hydrogen are avoided – another huge benefit for our customers. \nFlexible gas and steam power plants will remain a key component of a demand-driven power supply. They form the solid foundation of a diverse and clean energy mix – indispensable for meeting the world's current and future challenges. Our pressurized air-cooled generators complement the turbine packages of any manufacturer and meet grid and environmental requirements as well as your individual needs. \nOur generators can be flexibly integrated into combined cycle power plants or steam tailing applications. \nWe supply generators for large simple or combined cycle power plants, suitable for peak, intermediate or base load duty, as well as cogeneration applications. \nRotating synchronous condensers are a proven, reliable solution for ancillary grid services guaranteeing frequency and voltage stability, plus the ability to ride through grid disturbances. Today’s emerging power systems are dominated by converter connected renewable power producers which are susceptible to decreased short circuit power and system inertia, making them more sensitive to electrical faults and sudden load imbalances. Rotating synchronous condensers are significantly less sensitive to these issues. \nSynchronous condensers have the unique ability to respond inherently without any time delay to fault or load imbalance events. They increase the short circuit power by their overload capability and improve the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) by the physical inertia contribution. Furthermore synchronous condensers provide dynamic voltage control by supplying and absorbing reactive power to and from the grid. \nA synchronous condenser solution comprises a generator connected to the high voltage network through a transformer. It is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once synchronized with the network, the generator behaves like a synchronous motor without load, compensating reactive power and stabilizing the system, in case of a fault or imbalance events. \nYou would like a brochure, are interested in technical details or further information?

The solution is preconfigured with standard microgrid dashboards showing all necessary information, with several levels of detail. \nMain functions: \nDispatch Optimizer supports Customers to perform optimal in complex trading/ marketing processes \nPer definition and standards, microgrids are entities which manage their own decentralized power production and consumption and are capable of island operation mode. \nDepending on a business case, many microgrids, always run in on-grid mode. Managing a microgrid with multiple different decentralized resources requires a hybrid microgrid controller to provide automated and at the same time optimal operation for the customer. \nOmnivise Hybrid Control is the perfect solution for large and mid-size microgrids, e.g., for IPPs, islands, industries, data centers, mines. \nIntegrating large amount of renewable resources (PV, wind) on islands and remote areas which rely on conventional diesel generation can reduce overall fuel and operational costs. \nThis however requires integration of additional energy storage (batteries, H₂) in a microgrid to ensure the reliable and stable power supply. \nRenewable resources (PV, wind, green H₂) and batteries can be well integrated with existing and new combined cycle power plants in a microgrid to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the overall system efficiency. \nWith increasing cost of electricity and at the same time demand, C&I customers can install own generation to reduce their energy bills, and at the same time be able to run their essential load in off-grid mode. With CHPs and CCPs thermal energy is extracted for industrial processes, heating/cooling or electricity recuperation.

The company’s additive manufacturing capabilities comprise mechanized cladding, micro laser welding, cold spray silver coating and laser metal deposition. \nThe inauguration of the prototype of a serial production line at the gas turbine factory in Berlin marks an important milestone for the IDEA project. It is part of the initiative “Line integration of additive manufacturing processes”, funded by German Ministry of Education and Research. \nSiemens Energy is driving the industrialization and commercialization of AM processes. Here are some examples of 3D printed parts working in the real world. \nSelective laser melting (SLM), also known as direct metal laser melting (DMLM) or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is a rapid prototyping, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM) technique designed to use a high power-density laser to melt and fuse metallic powders together. SLM is often considered a subcategory of selective laser sintering (SLS). The SLM process has the ability to fully melt the metal material into a solid three-dimensional part unlike SLS. \nLaser cladding is a form of surface coating that incorporates the use of lasers and a feeding mechanism to coat the substrate with a layer of desired metal or ceramic material. The laser melts the metal and coats the moving substrate with a fine layer. The feed metal is fully melted while the laser also transfers some of its energy to the substrate. This allows for the creation of a strong metallurgical bond between the substrate and the coating. \nWire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a large-scale metal AM technology that uses an arc welding process to produce metal parts additively. \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy.\n \nSebastian Piegert, Technology Field Lead Additive Manufacturing, shared linsights on the Siemens Energy AM approach and strategy. \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems.\n \nAdditive Manufacturing technology is enabling the transformation of energy systems. \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions.\n \nOur webinar throws a light on the topic from different angles: Tobias Müller (E.ON) shares his experiences from user perspective, Markus Glasser (EOS) reports on the latest developments as a technology supplier and Vladimir Navrotsky and Markus Seibold give an overview on Siemens Energy’s experiences and solutions. \nPlease fill out the form below and receive your download link! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Additive Manufacturing\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/service/additive-manufacturing.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Oil and Gas Onshore Solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/oil-gas/onshore-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nThe ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) is driving the rapid pace of digital adoption across multiple industries.

When the pipeline content (mix of oil and water) cools down, the temperature is approaching the ambient seawater temperature. \nThis can cause flow assurance challenges such as flow line blockage or reduced capacity. The pipeline content should therefore be kept above the critical temperature - depending on water cut, salt content and pressure, the hydrates will form typically at temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius. \nTraditionally, chemicals (methanol) have been used to remedy this problem. Alternatively, hydrates can be prevented using thermal insulation in combination with additional electric heating. In this approach, a single-phase electrical current is supplied to heat the pipe content above the hydrate formation temperature. The heating method is known as Direct Electric Heating (DEH) as the steel-built pipeline is heated by forcing single-phase current directly through the pipe steel. Qualified by Statoil in the mid-90s, there have been number of projects in the North Sea with more than 100 kilometres of pipelines heated by DEH. Another pipeline heating technology which has been adopted recently is electrical heat tracing / electrical trace heating (EHT / ETH), which uses three-phase cable circuits.  \nSiemens Energy offers DEH power supply systems to prevent hydrate formation during planned and unplanned process shutdown.  \nOur systems will contribute to a consistent flow of hydrocarbons despite challenging fluid characteristics and temperature conditions at the seabed. The respective modules of the systems may contain power electronic components as well as control and protection units for the topside equipment and subsea pipeline to be installed on the platform deck. \nThe systems are designed to control, compensate and balance the single-phase electrical load that the pipeline and the piggyback cable constitute. Each of the systems is customized to the power requirements and electrical properties of the specified subsea load, in both “heat-up” and “maintain heat” mode. The systems are designed to be optimally tuned at any load condition to ensure an excellent power factor, low harmonic feedback, and to have low negative sequence current - important for minimal impact to the platform power grid. \nAuxiliary systems for fiber-optic temperature monitoring of the piggyback cables are offered optionally, as well as solutions for remote connection to the modules’ control and protection system via a secure internet connection.  \nSiemens Energy has a conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit. \nOur conceptual design for a Subsea Medium Voltage ETH Power Unit, allows subsea power distribution to multiple ETH loads, and uses components already qualified in the Subsea Power Grid program, together with field-proven topside components, in order to achieve a reliable design.  In combination with other subsea power grid units, like the subsea transformer, even higher degrees of flexibility and customization for specific project requirements can be achieved.   \nSiemens Energy also offers connectivity solutions for ETH applications using the SpecTRON 8 family.    \nLearn more about our ETH SpecTRON 8 solution - Connectors SpecTRON 8  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Pipeline Heating\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/direct-electrical-heating.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT-400 Industrial gas turbine\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgt-400.html\" has the following content:\nThe Siemens Energy SGT-400 is a durable twin-shaft gas turbine suitable for power generation and mechanical drive applications in the 10 – 15 MW power band, suitable for all climates, onshore and offshore.  \nIt boasts operational and fuel flexibility, low emissions, and overall efficiency, with enhancements to rotors and blades as well as a 33% increase in time between overhauls.  \nIts can-annular design with single-stage combustion enables it to burn a wide range of fuel compositions efficiently at all loads, meeting stringent emissions standards even at low loads, and offering seamless true dual-fuel capability. \n*Service intervals can be extended based on operating profile.    \nA large team of cross-trained field service technicians and engineers, 24/7 help desks and remote monitoring make the SGT-400 easy to own and operate over its entire lifecycle. \nCan burn many fuel types and qualities, including liquid fuels and gases with high inerts, thanks to controls technology.

Additionally, it offers true dual-fuel DLE capability with automatic changeover from primary to secondary fuel at any load. \nTo provide high fuel flexibility, the SGT-400 uses a robust can-annular combustion system with six reverse-flow tubular chambers and a high energy igniter in each combustor. \nThe SGT-400’s DLE combustor burns a great variety of gaseous and liquid fuels and features clean combustion with low emissions. \nThe field-proven DLE combustor provides clean combustion with low emissions across a wide operating range in the SGT-400.  \nIt utilizes six reverse-flow tubular combustion chambers around a high-pressure casing, each capable of gas-only, liquid-only, or dual-fuel operation. The control system ensures smooth, automatic changeover of fuel across the power range.  \nThe DLE combustion system enables the turbine to comply with emission regulations even at lower operation loads down to 30%, with NOx emissions of ≤ 15 ppmvd (corrected to 15% O2 dry). \nThe SGT-400 DLE combustion system meets the most stringent NOx and CO emissions legislation. \nSince NOx emission increases exponentially with rising temperature, it is crucial to ensure that air and fuel are well mixed. The Siemens DLE combustion system uses a lean air-fuel premix with multiple fuel injection points to achieve low emissions over a wide load range. \nIn our download section, you can find brochures, technical papers, and more.

Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.        \nOur ideas grow from experience: In 1866, Werner von Siemens developed the first electric generator, and Siemens Energy built the first power plant in 1885. This spirit of invention is what has driven our power business ever since. Since 1990, we`ve brought more than a hundred turnkey power plants online, supplying hundreds of GW of electricity. Each of them has been constructed with customized solutions to meet our customers’ individual challenges. In other words, we’ve always been involved in supplying electricity to industries, regions, and people all over the world. That’s our purpose. Let’s make tomorrow different today! \nWe have the most extensive in-house technology portfolio on the market, which allows us to choose the most appropriate products to incorporate into your solution. That  allows you to benefit from our expertise as an OEM EPC and from the certainty of one-stop procurement – for every one of your projects. \nSustainability for your power plant project: EHS measures minimize the risks \nHealth and safety are our top priority – for our own employees and those of our suppliers and partners. That’s why we work with management plans and assessments, and that’s why we train and test everyone involved. We regularly visit sites and evaluate the commitment of each individual participant, whether they’re in the office or at the construction site – with one clear goal: to keep people safe from harm. Our EHS (environment, health, and safety) measures significantly cut accident rates and downtime. And in the end, they pay off for your project: with a positive transfer of knowledge to your local team, faster completion, reduced non-conformance-costs (NCCs), and a good reputation. \nLowering CO₂ by using hydrogen for power generation \nNew gas power plants being build today will very likely be converted at a later stage to burn a blend of hydrogen up to 100% during the lifetime of the plant. This means that provisions for cost efficient later retrofit to hydrogen are essential. Hydrogen ready should not be confused with hydrogen capability.  However, today’s new power plants will typically start operating with natural gas for several years. \nIt is therefore crucial to build new natural gas fired power plants that can easily be upgraded and converted to hydrogen operations as hydrogen becomes available to the operator. By doing so, natural gas fired power plants are future-proof and will be fit to meet the amount of hydrogen for which it has been made ready, with minimal conversion costs. \nYou can choose between different scopes of supply – from core turbine only, gas turbine packages up to complete gas-fired power plants. \nPackage \nPower island \nPower core \nTurnkey power plant \nMore than 1,500 Siemens Energy power plants are in operation around the world.

Despite their ruggedness and reliability, they are susceptible to aging and wear over their decades of use. \nWhy Siemens Energy? Transformer Lifecycle Management (TLM) - a strategic way to increase value. TLM allows for targeted expenditure planning and controlled timing of new investments, avoiding unforeseen outages and minimizing planned downtimes. It also reduces environmental impact while maximizing transformer availability. This service concept applies to all transformers in your network, irrespective of age, manufacturer, or power. We service all generations of transformers.  TLM is designed to prevent unplanned downtimes and optimize planned maintenance measures. We recognize that even planned service interruptions have increasingly shorter windows. Our solution includes mobile technologies and methods, with expert teams that provide on-site support. From oil-drying systems to high-voltage testing stations, our mobile repair workshops are fast, flexible, and can be integrated into your operations. This complements the performance spectrum of Siemens Energy's repair facility, enhancing service reliability. \nOur time- and condition-based maintenance services follow original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations to slow down the aging process of transformers, extending their lifespan and efficiency. We offer specialized services including oil regeneration, transformer drying, and moisture monitoring to prevent damage and ensure peak performance. Our local qualified experts conduct on-site investigations and provide comprehensive repair solutions, including parts and materials, failure analysis, and on-site transformer repair using a mobile facility for efficiency and convenience. \nDIAG ensures the reliability and longevity of transformers through comprehensive diagnostic modules that assess individual transformers and entire fleets. The service offers three levels of assessment, including inspection, diagnostics, and high voltage testing, providing transparent and objective evaluations for informed decision-making. Experienced service professionals provide detailed test reports with recommended actions to prevent unexpected failures and maximize transformer utilization. By utilizing DIAG, transformer owners and operators can optimize maintenance strategies, avoid unplanned outages, and improve overall safety and security of operation.   \nOur services include insulating oil analyses and material testing, which involve diagnostic test procedures for ageing analysis, condition detection, and new state assessments of oils and insulating materials. The lifespan of a transformer depends on the ageing of the insulating materials, and our services aim to recognize material degradation and extend transformer lifespan through trend analysis and targeted maintenance. The Material Testing Laboratory for Transformers offers comprehensive services, including sample collection, analysis, and assessment, to identify ageing processes and ensure reliable performance. \nDepending on the initial situation, it may be expedient from an economic standpoint to have an older or damaged transformer overhauled at one of our Siemens Energy production locations. Based on our experience, an overhaul restores transformer availability for an extended time with no restrictions in operating reliability. There are advantages over the production of a new transformer. An overhaul and restoration are usually significantly more cost-effective and time-efficient. Our customers also experience significantly shorter outage times. \nIn many cases, it is not possible or cost-effective to bring the transformer to one of our manufacturing plants for repair because of the necessary heavy transport. \nIn these cases we can offer our customers on-site repair. An individual solution may be elaborated depending on the existing infrastructure. \nSee the animation: \nREG, the online regeneration technology, can clean aged or corrosive transformer oil, restore its dielectric properties, and increase the transformer availability. Regeneration processes requires special equipment, high competence, and long-time experience of staff. Siemens Energy operators have experience in online regeneration of more than 300 transformers with different design, connections and at various ambient temperatures. REG, removes degradation products and corrosive compounds from transformer oil during normal transformer operations. This not only ensures operational efficiency but also offers substantial economic and ecological advantages.  \nPower transformers degrade over time, with moisture in the insulating paper hastening this process. This moisture can come from insufficient drying during production, environmental damage, or the degradation process itself. A single oil treatment won't have a lasting effect as 98% of the moisture is in the insulating paper.  Siemens Energy's TLM method effectively slows down the unavoidable aging process within your transformers, thus extending their lifespan. Our widely recognized DRY is a stationary and continuous transformer drying system. \nIn addition to our repair and maintenance services, we provide modernization of hardware and software with state-of-the-art versions. We also offer retrofitting of individual components to maintain delivery capacity, as well as overhauling transformers to ensure optimal functionality. Furthermore, we provide system-wide feature upgrades and performance enhancements to meet evolving operational needs. \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

Companies need to demonstrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or verify the volume of CO2 emissions in their products. In addition, there is a growing demand to prove the sustainability of green products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthetic fuels, green steel, and other commodities. \nWith CertaLink Energy Certification, we can track the environmental impact of sustainable production processes along the entire product cycle. \nCertaLink Energy Certification is already proving the green origin of the e-fuels applications in the Porsche motorsport fleet at Haru Oni. Step by step, Haru Oni is transforming the fuel industry, supported by the certification process to validate the green origins of e-fuels.  \nDeveloped with innovation partners TÜV SÜD and the German Energy Agency (dena), CertaLink Energy Certification uses blockchain technology to connect physical assets to digital decentralized infrastructure. It tracks the low and zero carbon energy from source to consumption along the value chain, validating the energy's origin plus providing detailed insights and attributes. As a result of automated and tamper-proof recording and tracking of energy-specific data, a CertaLink certificate is valid around the world through the entire low or zero carbon value chain.   \nAre you already a registered customer? If yes, you can access your personal dashboard here. \nIf you need assistance, please find your service contact here. \nIf you are not registered yet, please get in touch. \nSustainability certificates such as CertaLink Energy Certificates enable \"Sustainability Claims\" in an automated, tamper-proof, and government-approved manner. Sustainably certified products have a higher market value and offer benefits like customs and tax relief for imports and exports These green energy certifications are required by all companies that wish to market their products as sustainable. With a CertaLink certificate, you can trace the zero or low carbon origin of your products throughout the entire value chain. \nWhether you are planning your facility, or you have already established a production facility, you can connect to the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. We will connect the certification manager with your Instrumentation and Control system or smart meters to access your measurement data and generate green energy certificates for your products. Plant shutdowns are usually not necessary. \nThe CertaLink certification process is comparable to classic ISO certifications, but the products are continuously certified per production unit. To receive the corresponding automated issued certificate, companies must adhere to a conventional certification approach.  \nWe will advise you to choose the optimal certification scheme for your business purposes and prepare the certification together with you. There are document checklists depending on the selected certification scheme. A detailed list of required documents will be provided to you so that you can prepare your sustainability certification in a structured manner.   \nIn order to apply an internationally accepted renewable energy certification standard, we are partnering with independent certification bodies, e.g. TÜV SÜD and dena, the German Energy Agency. \nIt is important to distinguish between three types of fees. An onboarding fee is charged during the connection and commissioning of the CertaLink Energy Certification Manager. A yearly membership fee is charged after completed onboarding. Later on, each certificate creation will incur a fee. \nThe CertaLink Energy Certification Manager is based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Unlike public chains, where transactions are publicly available to everyone, in CertaLink the data is processed on a private permissioned blockchain. It means that only independent trusted and explicitly contracted node operators are participating in the network with limited access to structured data. All site data is transferred in encoded format and converted into declarations by DLT smart contracts. These declarations can be shared based on commercial operator settings. \n“TÜV SÜD has a clear focus on sustainability and decarbonization. We are excited to join forces with Siemens Energy and dena to innovate together on the Clean Energy Certification platform. This new service ensures trust and enables the trace of origin across the Power-to-X value chains.” \nReiner Block CEO Division Industry Service TÜV SÜD AG \n“The CertaLink Energy Certification Manager is the solution to a complex problem.

Our advanced STATCOM (static synchronous compensator) with modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology provides additional benefits compared to conventional solutions for reactive power compensation. While conventional SVC installations already provide a highly dynamic solution for voltage regulation in the power grid, the modular multilevel system SVC PLUS® is even faster and offers additional benefits. Siemens Energy also offers mobile SVC PLUS® solutions that support short-term grid changes and rapid restoration after severe incidents.  \nSVC PLUS® combines the benefits of static synchronous compensation (STATCOM) and modular multilevel converter technology with an optimized amount of components. \nDespite its outstanding performance, SVC PLUS® requires relatively few system components, which simplifies the design, planning, and engineering of new projects. The components used for SVC PLUS® comprise proven and robust components such as industrial class insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT), reactors, capacitors, and in utility applications AC power transformers.  \nThanks to modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology our SVC PLUS® offers great flexibility regarding design and layout of converters and substations. The modularity and the low number of system components also reduce commissioning time compared to complex conventional SVC systems. \nSVC PLUS® to ensure power quality through fast voltage support \nMobile STATCOM - fast grid stabilization and restoration  \nOptimal stability and quality \nThe SVC PLUS® is geared to quickly inject significant inductive or capacitive power. Thus the SVC PLUS® provides improved dynamic stability of transmission systems to reduce the risk of voltage collapse and blackout while avoiding deterioration of the power quality due to its multilevel configuration: generating unwanted harmonics is widely avoided. \nIn harmony with harmonics – and best flicker reduction \nHarmonics generation is low due to the use of MMC technology, resulting also in low noise emissions. The extremely fast control allows in industrial applications highly efficient flicker reduction and even active reduction of the lower harmonics caused by a nonlinear load such as an electric arc furnace. \nFastest response – efficient solution  \nThe standardized component design allows minimized engineering efforts and provides an overall fast, efficient, modular, and cost-effective solution. The SVC PLUS® control with its most advanced concept offers unsurpassed speed in controlling the IGBT semiconductors to precisely generate the desired flow of energy between the converter and the feeding network. \nDepending on your needs, Siemens Energy provides the right solutions for grid stabilization and load compensation of any scope. The portfolio comprises the conventional STATCOM and the advanced SVC PLUS® in manifold combinations, and the mobile SVC PLUS® systems that can be moved to any place in short time. \nSmall footprint, huge performance \nThe SVC PLUS® is an advanced STATCOM (static synchronous compensator). By using the voltage-sourced converter (VSC) technology based on Siemens Energy modular multilevel converter (MMC) design, it offers high economical and technical flexibility by its modular design. The footprint of an SVC PLUS® installation is smaller than a conventional SVC installation of the same rating, by up to 50 percent.  \nReduced project duration \nIn order to reduce the civil work effort, Siemens Energy developed the containerized SVC PLUS®. The solution requires no building and less installation effort. Furthermore, the containerized design results in lower project execution time. The containerized SVC PLUS® includes the matured and proven technology of the SVC PLUS® with the best grid stability performance and a small footprint.  \nGrid stabilization – anywhere, anytime \nThe mobile STATCOM is Siemens Energy’s multi-tool for transmission grids that enables temporary grid support and grid resilience against emergencies. The preconfigured SVC PLUS® container combines major components in one housing and enables “plug and play” cable interconnection. A reactor container that contains the reactor coils including conventional bus bar arrangement complements it. The mobile STATCOM is the optimal solution for rapid service restoration after severe incidences, line rework, and grid changes, for example during power plant shutdowns. \nLarge electrical consumers in industrial processes often show a very dynamic behavior. Looking at the most extreme case of electrical loads worldwide, Electrical Arc Furnaces (EAFs) – where a single unit can have a consumption of up to around 300 MVA (the consumption of a city of 300.000 inhabitants) – their load characteristic is extremely dynamic and stochastic, creating a number of disturbances to the feeding grid, such as fast voltage fluctuations causing the phenomenon of flickering of light, bad power factor and asymmetric loading of the 3 phases of the supply system, as well generation of harmonics due to the non linear current of the electric arc. To counteract the disturbances of such industrial loads, an innovative and versatile compensation solution for enhancing power quality is required - SVC PLUS® provides the ideal solution. Our advanced STATCOM (static synchronous compensator) with modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology provides additional benefits compared to conventional solutions for load compensation. While conventional SVC installations already provide a highly dynamic solution for power quality improvement at the the grid connection point of an industrial power distribution system, the modular multilevel system SVC PLUS® is even faster and offers multiple additional benefits. Depending on the size and characteristics of the load and the utility regulations, Siemens Energy offers different SVC PLUS® concepts to mitigate the unwanted impact of the load to the grid. \nWith SVC PLUS®, Siemens Energy further enhanced the capabilities of a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) with modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology. Whenever your applications require a highly dynamic solution for voltage regulation, the modular multilevel system SVC PLUS® is the right choice.  \nSVC PLUS® for industrial applications - introduction \nDespite its outstanding performance, SVC PLUS® requires relatively few system components, which simplifies the design, planning, and engineering of new projects. The components used for SVC PLUS® comprise proven and robust components such as industrial class insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT), reactors, filter circuits, typically connected directly to the medium voltage busbar that feeds the load to be compensated.  \nThanks to modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology our SVC PLUS® offers great flexibility regarding design and layout of converters in the industrial substation. The modularity and the low number of system components also benefit commissioning time required. \nDepending on your needs, Siemens Energy provides the right solutions for load compensation of any scope. The portfolio comprises the advanced SVC PLUS® in manifold combinations, such as the SVC PLUS® Compact for smaller load compensation, SVC PLUS® for medium size and SVC PLUS® 2+1 for high power applications. \nSmallest footprint for load compensation of small to medium size industrial plants \nThe SVC PLUS® is an advanced STATCOM (static synchronous compensator). By using the voltage-sourced converter (VSC) technology based on Siemens Energy modular multilevel converter (MMC) design it offers high economical and technical flexibility by its modular design. The footprint of an SVC PLUS® installation is smaller than a conventional SVC installation of the same rating, by up to 50 percent. \nThe \"small solution\" offer the right load-compensating performance for small- to medium-size industrial plants: excellent voltage stabilization provides the best preconditions for stable production, securing power quality parameters secures hassle-free connection to the public grid. \nLoad compensation for large industrial plants or for weak grid connection \nMore and more often, the necessity arises to set up industrial plants with large fluctuating consumers in regions with weak electrical infrastructure – the most prominent example is the electrical arc furnace for melting scrap steel: Extreme variation of electric power consumption combined with generation of harmonics characterize the behavior of this consumer of electric power. Maintaining power quality parameters on the other hand is often a precondition to connect such a plant to the public grid. \nThis constellation calls for a compensation system of highest performance. To achieve this task, filter circuits are added in parallel to the multilevel converter (MMC) as in the SVC PLUS® Compact to fully and optimally utilize the complete range of reactive power of the converter. \nLoad compensation of very large industrial loads \nThe SVC PLUS® 2+1 is the Siemens Energy approach to very large industrial electric consumers: Electric arc furnaces nowadays often are in the range of 200MVA – a tough task also for the load compensation system. A combination of 2 SVC PLUS® converters, together with filter circuits where required, is the concept of choice, that also offers highest achievable results in flicker reduction and improvement of other power quality parameters. This solution additionally offers concept-inherent partial mutual backup – in case of a failure of any of the 3 functional groups SVC PLUS® converter 1, converter 2 or filter circuits the faulty functional group is switched off, but the remaining system stays in operation with reduced power, which allows the load to continue operation. \nDepending on the actual short circuit power level a power reduction of the load may be necessary, if the grid cannot tolerate temporarily the reduced power quality improvement of the remaining compensation system. \nShould the load be even larger, the concept can be expanded by adding a further converter. \nSVC PLUS FS® (E-STATCOM)  \nAn SVC PLUS® frequency stabilizer is able to emulating system inertia by boosting high active power into the grid when needed. It also offers voltage support by means of reactive power compensation. \nControl & Protection (C&P) systems are key to managing power flows and protecting grid components in HVDC and FACTS plants. Both tasks have to be considered in light of increasingly complex grid architectures and fluctuating power infeed from renewable energy sources. For many Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSO), this leads to three major challenges: first, fast reaction to market needs and short lead time of the C&P system. Second, reliable and secure operations throughout the entire lifecycle while safeguarding low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). And last but not least, the C&P system should be easy to expand for new solutions and services. This is crucial in order to cope with the ongoing transformation of the energy system and to leverage the potential of future innovations. With our new modular C&P platform Grid Flow PLUS, we’re addressing all of these challenges. \nC&P platform - Grid Flow PLUS  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"SVC PLUS (STATCOM)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/svcplus.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Products and Services\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services.html\" has the following content:\nOverview \nExplore our offerings designed to support your industrial decarbonization \nDiscover our solutions for applications you need to master the energy transition \nGet to know our product offerings designed to support your energy transition journey \nFind the ideal service solution tailored to your needs \nLooking to leverage your expertise and maximize the potential of your energy technology? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Products and Services\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGT-A05\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgt-a05-ae.html\" has the following content:\nBased on proven aeroderivative design, the SGT-A05 gas turbines are flexible, compact and lightweight designs that are ideally suited for decentralized power generation offering high efficiency and fast start-up capabilities. \nThe SGT-A05 gas turbine variants generate electrical power outputs between 4 and 6 MW for applications such as base load, co-generation, combined heat and power, mobile power and emergency power. \nThe SGT-A05 is proven to operate in various challenging conditions and locations around the world, including the North Sea, West Africa, Siberia, Brazil, Alaska, Southeast Asia and the desert regions of the Middle East.

Thermal overloads in the lines and a growing number of cases in which frequency and voltage come critically close to acceptable range limits, or even exceed them, threaten grid stability and the transmission infrastructure, and often require costly redispatch intervention to deal with current and voltage factors. Compared to traditional power flow controllers, UPFC PLUS® controls power flow in just milliseconds. The unified power flow controller UPFC PLUS® thus stabilizes the AC grid even when critical situations develop suddenly (Grid Code N-1). That means UPFC PLUS® lets you get the most from your existing grid capacity while maintaining maximum protection, reducing the risk of power failures, and minimizing redispatch costs.       \nEven when sudden faults occur, UPFC PLUS® stabilizes the AC grid, offering highly efficient support for Grid Code N-1 situations affecting the existing grid infrastructure. Its modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology enables a sufficiently rapid response time of just a few milliseconds in order to prevent power failures. \nUPFC PLUS® N-1 \nFACTS for a CO₂ free power supply \nWith a response time of just milliseconds, UPFC PLUS® is significantly faster than a phase shifter so you can intervene much faster in critical situations.  \nUnlike a phase shifter, UPFC PLUS® is not only able to control power flow but also enables dynamic reactive power compensation and voltage control and it can also compensate for disruptive factors like vibration.  \nSystem voltages of 220, 400, and 500 kV can be accommodated, and for the 110 kV voltage level, a comparable solution can be implemented with MVDC PLUS®. Semiconductor technology makes UPFC PLUS® freely programmable, so it’s easy to adapt to local requirements and circumstances.  \nUPFC can control power distribution over a wide range, depending on the installed capacity and the nature of the transmission cable.  \nThe UPFC PLUS® solution is based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) architecture from voltage source converters (VSC) in semiconductor technology, as developed by Siemens Energy and already proven in SVC PLUS® and HVDC PLUS®. \nA unified power flow controller is used to control and influence the electrical energy transmitted through individual lines in intermeshed, supra-regional power networks. UPFC PLUS® can therefore be used to meet specific, contractually agreed power throughputs in intermeshed grids. \nThe scope of application is aimed at high-voltage electricity transmission networks using three-phase AC at voltage ranges of 220 kV to 500 kV, and its control functions make use of power electronics similar to the systems used in HVDC transmission. Unlike HVDC, the power electronics are not used directly for power transmission but to influence and modulate the AC current being transmitted. In power electronics, UPFC is an example of a flexible AC transmission system (FACTS). \nLike a traffic guidance system \nLike smart traffic guidance systems, UPFC PLUS® controls the power flow via available line capacity in the AC grid. \nReducing throughput costs  \nShort-term, high-volume infeed of renewables often leads to costs for energy throughput via third-party grids. UPFC PLUS® directs the electricity through your own high-voltage grid. \nAvoiding line overload  \nUnexpectedly high infeed levels from PV systems and wind turbines can cause overloads on individual lines. UPFC PLUS® directs the electricity effectively using available line capacity. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"UPFC PLUS\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/upfcplus.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Flex-Power Services\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/flex-power-services.html\" has the following content:\nThe global energy markets are changing and renewables are increasing, which leads to new operating profiles requiring higher operational flexibility for many fossil power plants.

As a first step, this can be achieved by making fuel usage more efficient. Later, this fossil fuel can be replaced with carbon-free fuel. Alternatively, heat production can also be electrified by using power from renewable energy. Existing heat networks can be transformed fast and at a large scale into cost-effective and flexible low-carbon energy systems. \nThere are several applications that can help you to decarbonize heat networks. At Siemens Energy, we provide tailor-made CHP and Power to Heat (P2H) solutions for residential, commercial, or industrial sectors. \nCHP generates electricity and heat from a single fuel source. Traditional heating plants emit varying amounts of CO2 depending on the fuel used. Thus, even a simple fuel switch may reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 50%. Additionally, converting the plant into a GT-powered CHP or a Combined Cycle Power Plant with heat extraction can significantly improve its electrical efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency can be as high as 90% while using as little fuel as possible. \nFind out which gas turbine fits best for your application. \nPower-to-heat (P2H) can be accomplished through heat pumps or electric boilers. Heat pumps utilize waste or environmental heat, raising its temperature with electricity. They produce the same heat using less electricity than electric boilers, leading to lower operational costs. Electric boilers require minimal capital investment and have quick installation. Induction-based technologies or innovative turboheaters are suitable for industrial processes requiring high temperatures. \nExplore our industrial-scale heat pump portfolio \nClean fuels, such as green hydrogen or biofuels, can drastically lower CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for fossil fuels in gas turbines. This is an effective way to future proof a combined cycle power plant and maximize its life cycle. Find out how much carbon footprint you can reduce by burning green hydrogen in your gas turbine. Calculate your carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and cost-savings potential on carbon certificates. \nCalculate your CO₂ emission reduction potential \nAnother decarbonization path is to transform fossil-fired heat generation by switching to sustainably produced biomass in Combined Heat and Power plants. When adding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), biomass- or biofuel-based CHP plants can be further transformed into bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), thus allowing for negative emissions and energy production at the same time.   \nLearn more about our biomass power plant solutions \nFor maximum efficiency, it often makes sense to combine different technologies. To make the best choice, there are several factors to consider, such as the required temperature level, dispatchable power needs, green electricity cost, availability of waste heat, and annual heat curve. For instance, if you have a lot of renewable energy, it makes sense to consider Power-to-Heat (P2H). \nAs most of the factors influencing the technology choice depend on the location of the heating network, there is no one-fits-all solution. However, a pre-selection of suitable technologies can be done, based on the temperature level that is required for the specific application. The matrix below shows the temperature level that can be achieved with different technologies. \nContact us today to find the best solution for decarbonizing your heat network! \nRepurposing existing power plants or heating plants can substantially contribute to decarbonizing your assets. A heating plant can be transformed into a cogeneration plant, and a thermal power plant can be turned into a CHP plant. Alternatively, you can convert the complete thermal plant into a Power to Heat application. \nWith our Brownfield transformation approach, you can convert existing assets within a short time frame into a low-carbon facility while re-using the existing infrastructure as much as possible.\n \nPower-to-heat (P2H) systems signal a paradigm shift in the capabilities of low-carbon energy systems. Since heat pumps or electric boilers can be exclusively powered by green electricity, it allows the integration of renewable energy sources in heat energy production—an integration that is both crucial and long overdue. \nBy adjusting their heat output in response to variations in renewable energy generation, power-to-heat systems can also provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Power-to-heat systems convert surplus renewable energy into usable thermal energy for local or central heating and cooling needs.\n \nDue to their high Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat pumps provide low carbon heat. They are completely carbon neutral when powered entirely by renewable energy.  \nHeat can be stored significantly more cost effectively than electricity. The combination of P2H with CHP stabilizes the power market. Heat pumps are preferably operated at times of low power prices due to surplus renewable energy. When power prices are high CHP plants can profitably sell power and produce heat at the same time. At peak heat demand it is possible to operate the heat pump together with the CHP plant. \nA new heat pump to help MVV achieve its goal of decarbonizing district heating in Mannheim, Germany \nReplacement of a Holland Board of Public Works coal plant with a new CHP plant at Holland Energy Park \nBrownfield engine exchange service and modernization of a combned cycle power plant of BASF \nTwo cutting-edge gas turbine packages for a new district heating power plant with an expected fuel efficiency of 93% \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Combined heat and power\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/distributed-power/combined-heat-and-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Oil and gas: solutions for safe, efficient and reliable operation\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-industry/oil-gas.html\" has the following content:\nThe world is evolving rapidly, with global population expected to rise nearly 30 percent by 2050.

Once these generators are shut down, their role in providing rotational inertia, short circuit power and voltage control, to help balance the grid system disappears with them also. Grid stability is, therefore, a vital consideration for transmission and distribution network operators, with increasing renewable penetration. \nWith the Rotating Grid Stabilizer (RGS) Conversion solutions, you can convert your existing power plant assets to a synchronous condenser to achieve grid stability. By utilizing power plants that may otherwise become stranded assets, RGS conversions provide necessary system inertia, short circuit power and reactive power to the grid for that balance.  \nInherent frequency response, the result of system inertia, is the ability of an electrical machine to absorb and store or inject energy in order to manage frequency. One way to do this is to use technology with a rotating mass, like flywheels and synchronous condensers, to store energy for short-term frequency support. This helps to prevent blackouts, due to a rapid change of frequency and maintains a stable grid, within its frequency limits.   \nYou can also generate additional revenue streams by providing additional active power with our hybrid conversion solution. \nEnsuring grid stability is key to integrating more renewable energy. Download our new white paper to explore how thermal power plants can support grid stability. \nTraditionally, grid stability is achieved through the dependence on the system strength and system inertia. System strength refers to the ability of the electricity grid to recover intact from major disturbances and it is provided by the short-circuit power of the generator or synchronous condenser. The same generator also provides system inertia which is critical to maintaining a steady frequency in the grid. And no matter the source of generated power, electrical grid systems rely on both for grid security, safety, and reliability. \nOur conversion approach is tailored to meet your needs. Building new infrastructure is one option, but the infrastructure that is already in place can be repurposed as well. Typically, we begin the project with a feasibility assessment to determine whether your assets can be converted to a Rotating Grid Stabilizer (RGS). The next step is to initiate a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study in order to achieve a successful RGS conversion. \nThe basic conversion provides a cost-optimized solution that converts existing turbogenerators into synchronous condensers quickly. We will also take care of installing a tailor-made solution for startup and accelerating the generator. \nGenerators can be extended with additional rotating mass from a flywheel to provide maximum inertia. Flywheels are operated in a partial vacuum and equipped with a cooling system to minimize friction losses and reduce cooling efforts. \nFor maximum flexibility, you can couple a gas or steam turbine with an additional SSS (Synchro-Self-Shifting) clutch between the generator and the turbine. The option also exists to add additional inertia with a flywheel coupled to the existing shaft line. \nPower up your New Built Plant with our cutting-edge Rotating Grid Stabilizer (RGS) solutions. Designed for seamless integration with large gas turbines like E-, F-, H- and HL-class, and large steam turbines such as SST-5000, a wider range of RGS offerings optimize plant design, reduce costs, and ensure top-notch performance.

Since power is produced on demand, it's critical to ensure that the power system frequency and voltage remain within normal ranges. Maintaining this balance is necessary to keep the power grid stable and efficient. \nTo ensure the grid remains stable and secure, it is essential to balance the electricity grid through frequency stabilization, short circuit power, and voltage control. Flexibility stabilization happens when system inertia responds to sudden load imbalances. The inertia delays the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF), so downstream grid stability controls can be executed. \nGrid inertia is the ability of a power grid to absorb changes in frequency without destabilizing the system. It is the key factor for maintaining grid stability. \nShort circuit power contribution is the ability of an electrical machine to inject high levels of current during a grid short circuit event, to ride through the fault and maintain a stable grid. \nVoltage control is the ability to inject and absorb reactive power to ensure a stable system voltage. This helps to reduce the voltage drop caused by the short circuit, limit the short circuit current, and quickly restore the power system's stability. It also enables keeping the system voltage within an acceptable range. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Rotating grid stabilizer conversion\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/rotating-grid-stabilizer.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Brownfield transformation\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/brownfield-transformation.html\" has the following content:\n* Above figures are estimates \nToday increasingly ambitious CO₂ targets are being set around the world. Reaching them won’t come about by itself. Apart from intelligent energy management and improved energy efficiency, we need to decarbonize power generation for utilities and industry. And since we can’t rebuild energy generation from scratch, assets viewed as burdensome today, such as coal power plants, must be repurposed as bridges to a new energy future. It’s called Brownfield Transformation: Converting existing power plants, so they help us reach the decarbonized economy we all aim for.  \nBrownfield Transformation: Building a bridge to a new energy future \nInnovative solutions for gas-fired power plants \nAs the world enters a new energy age, you’re looking for affordable solutions to reduce emissions while ensuring a reliable and safe power supply. But your fossil power plants hardly fit into a decarbonized future. So, you're faced with the decision to build either a new plant on a greenfield – or convert a brownfield power plant into a new productive asset.  \nBrownfield transformation is a holistic approach to decarbonizing legacy coal, oil and gas-fired power plants combined with the use of existing assets and infrastructure. For example, repowering steam power plants with new gas turbines. It also lays the foundation for a mid-term solution: turning existing brownfield power plants into decarbonized hybrid power plants, which could include power generation from renewable energy sources, various storage technologies, and grid stability services. All of this lays the groundwork for future net zero energy systems. Such systems could facilitate sector coupling by integrating renewables, industry, or mobility sectors with the help of green hydrogen.  \nIf your decarbonization needs turn out to be rather complex, we advise undertaking a detailed Energy System Design, which comprises a data-based integrated technology & business case study that examines future revenue streams and site surroundings using the available decarbonization portfolio. If technology preselection, e.g., fuel switch, energy storage, heat pumps, etc. is an important factor for you, we can develop your project directly. Whatever your approach, in the end your solution will be a combination of technology components tailored to your business case, market demands as well as efficiency and decarbonization goals. \nNo matter which solution you choose for your brownfield power plant conversion, there are numerous potential benefits: avoiding stranded assets; less investment compared to greenfield projects; shorter implementation time, including fewer permits to apply for. At the same time, you may even open new revenue streams. Apart from these advantages, brownfield conversion could also help further your reputation while you contribute to the common good. Altogether, not only will you support decarbonization efforts, but continuing to employ qualified personnel can also significantly ease socioeconomic strains on local communities. \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir...\n \nLegacy power-generation assets like coal-fired power plants can be given a new – and envir... \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe...\n \nAt brownfield operating sites, energy-efficiency gains can be realized by modernizing powe... \nWe are on the way to a carbon-free future, but we won't get there overnight.

Distribution transformers by Siemens Energy are designed for superior reliability, efficiency and environmental performance. A modular architecture paired with design options ensure cost efficiency and easy minimal maintenance. \nThe transformer’s core-and-coil assembly consists of the core, windings, and connecting cables. High-quality drying and quick filling with insulation oil play a key role in extending the transformer’s service life. Siemens Energy employs the latest techniques. For example, in vacuum low-frequency plants (LFH – low-frequency heating), the process of drying the solid insulation is combined with vacuum drying of the windings through low-frequency heating. The active part is heated by applying low-frequency current (< 1 Hz) to the high-voltage windings with the low-voltage windings short-circuited. While still in the plant, transformers are filled with preheated insulation liquid which is absorbed by the insulation material, thus preventing the intake of oxygen. \nThe iron core forms the central element of every transformer. High-grade, cold-rolled – and, depending on requirements laser-treated – metal sheets are precision-cut using computer-controlled machines to ensure compliance with even the smallest tolerances. The individual sheets are then assembled into cores using the step-lap technique or, in the case of transformers with a lower power rating, using precise winding technology. In this way, Siemens Energy's fluid-immersed distribution transformers achieve an especially good flux distribution at the joints, resulting in exceptionally low losses and minimal no-load noise. \nTransformer windings are subject to extremely high electrical and mechanical stresses and must therefore be protected. The transformer windings of Siemens Energy distribution transformers are made of copper or aluminum. Low-voltage windings are made from strip or flat wire, and high-voltage windings are manufactured from round or profile wire. The use of insulating paper partially coated with epoxy resin (diamond-dotted paper) bonds the winding into a compact block during the drying process and additionally increases the short-circuit capacity. \nThe layer insulation is adapted to the alternating voltage strain that occurs in daily operation. Large-scale oil channels are provided to ensure sufficient cooling of the windings and to avoid hot spots. All leads are short-circuit-proof and surge-proof, contributing to the high reliability of the Siemens Energy transformer – and to an above-average service life. \nWhether during transport or operation, the tank must remain sealed tight under mechanical stress and regardless of wind or weather. Corrosion protection is especially important. The surface is sandblasted and then multicoated. Upon request, hot-dip galvanization can provide even better protection. \nThe distribution transformer’s tank must dissipate the entire heat loss. In hermetically sealed transformers, the corrugated walls absorb the changes in the insulation liquid’s volume. Alternatively, the transformer can be designed as an open system or fitted with an oil conservator that compensates for the additional volume. \nSome regions also use smooth-walled tanks and built-in radiators. Hermetically sealed units sometimes have an air or gas cushion to compensate for oil expansion. The sheet-steel lid is bolted – or, upon request, welded – to the tank. The steel thickness and the bracing are dimensioned to ensure that the lid withstands all necessary stress. \nTransformers of Siemens Energy are dispatched to the customer only after successfully passing the final inspection and testing. Each Siemens Energy transformer factory has a high-voltage test bay, where specialists conduct a wide range of tests, from voltage tests and temperature-rise tests, to special tests for insulation resistance, partial discharge measurement, harmonics, and noise level. Short-circuit, vibration and othe special tests are performed in internationally recognized and approved institutes. Siemens Energy tests in accordance with the applicable standards and provides our customers with additional certificates on request. \nDistribution transformers by Siemens Energy cover a wide range of applications. \nLow losses and efficient operation \nFlame retardant, short-circuit proof and mechanically strong, Fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN withstand even the harshest conditions. They transform the voltage from the generator to the medium-voltage level needed for transmission. Siemens Energy offers special Fluid-immersed distribution transformers for wind farms and solar parks. \nMinimized downtime and maximized energy efficiency \nLike large buildings or infrastructures, datacenters too rely on distribution transformers to regulate the voltage level of the energy they source and keep regulation losses low. \nHigh efficiency and long service life \nThe winding design of Siemens Energy fluid-immersed distribution transformers IND ensures reliable absorption of radial, axial, and contraction forces. Fluid-immersed distribution transformers IND are suitable for heavy-duty drives, e.g. in steel mills, oil rigs, offshore installations, and conveyance facilities.  \nStable power supply for homes and businesses \nSiemens Energy fluid-immersed distribution transformers enhance grid stability by automatically adapting its transformation ratio to correspond to current load. They help utilities better accommodate infeed from renewable resources, while staying within a permitted voltage band. They fit in all normal compact stations. \nSiemens Energy offers two types of fluid-immersed distribution transformers – FITformers® and voltage regulators. They are used to convert electrical energy of higher voltage; usually up to 36 kV, to a lower voltage, usually 250 or 450 V, with an identical frequency before and after the transformation. \nStandard fluid-immersed transformers are crucial elements of suburban areas, forming the link between the electrical grid and consumers. Ratings for medium-sized fluid-immersed transformers stand between 2,500 kVA and 6,300kVA. They offer a maximum voltage capacity of 36kV. \nLarge distribution transformers come with higher voltage capacity and power level than medium-sized fluid-immersed transformers.  The technology differs to ensure the transformer will function at maximum capacity. The voltage of a large distribution transformer can go up to 145kV and its power rating from 6.3 up to 30MVA. \nPole-mounted transformers are available as single-phase or 3-phase units. Siemens Energy also offers pad-mounted distribution transformers with the same ratings as pole-mounted units. Pole-mounted distribution transformers are specifically built for applications in North America because the electric grid there differs from those in other parts of the world, such as Europe or Eastern Asia. Their voltage level and power capacity are similar to those of standard medium-sized  fluid-immersed transformer, with a voltage level of up to 36kV and and a rating of up to 2,500kVA. \nWind turbine operators need reliable and safe transformers so that the turbine never fails. With their expertise in transformers since 1892, and about 10,000 units built for wind farms in the last 20 years, Siemens Energy has been at the frontline of wind application transformers technology. An extensive research and development budget and senior engineering experts have contributed to making Siemens Energy the leading supplier for this application. \nTransformers for wind applications convert MV to LV with identical frequency. Ratings: ≤ 20MVA and ≤ 145 kV \nOn-shore and off-shore design  \nIn wind applications, the characteristics of the transformer depend on the nature of the project. Wind farms on-shore and off-shore will require different power levels. \nOn-shore: 4.0 - 10MVA Off shore: 10.0 - 20.0MVA for all types, for installation in nacelles and towers, with forced cooling oil/air, high temperature materials; 6.0 - 10.0 MVA with forced cooling oil/water, massive tank for highest mechanical loads, and for installation in the nacelle.  \nTried-and-tested quality \nThe Fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN has been subjected to numerous tests according to international standards to ensure maximum capacity and longevity. This includes extensive internal and external programs to test its suitability, Such as successful testing of short-circuit and vibration stability, highest corrosion, heat run tests as well as salt spray tests for components for offshore application. \n1 transformer, 3 possible locations \nFor wind application, Fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN can be installed in three areas within the wind farm: in the transformer substation located beside the wind turbines, inside the wind turbine tower, or they can even be directly installed inside the nacelle of the turbine. Ratings for this particular application can go up to 9,8MVA and come with a rated voltage of up to 66 kV. \nSiemens Energy builds resilient and customizable distribution transformers which not only deliver reliable and superior performance in harshest conditions, but also perfectly fit the needs of customers in industry. Siemens Energy's fluid-immersed distribution transformers IND are designed to supply energy for heavy-duty drives for steel mills, oil rigs, offshore installations, and conveyance facilities, and for the complete range of uses for drives in industry. \nStatic converter facilities with appropriate valves are required for transforming and controlling electric energy for these applications. Static converter transformers provide the link to the supply network. They must endure heavier dynamic and thermal stress due to rapid changes in the load and allow for frequent start-uploads. Siemens Energy's special winding design achieves a high short-circuit withstand capability making the transformer insusceptible to the stress caused by frequent drive peak loads. Another positive factor is the great heat capacity and high overload capability of this type of transformer. \nSiemens Energy has developed a laboratory-tested painting system and corrosion protection (e.g. salt spray tests) for Siemens Energy fluid-immersed distribution transformers IND used for application or in chemical environment.    \nInstalled next to the solar panels in a transformer substation, fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN for solar application come with a rating of up to 5 MVA and a rated voltage of up to 36kV. Thanks to Siemens Energy's transformers’ touch-proof design, fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN can be installed both outside and inside without extra housings. \nSolar farms face harsh weather conditions and still need operate at all times. Its design options make fluid-immersed distribution transformers REN a highly reliable solution – resistant to high corrosion, harsh weather conditions and temperature variations. \nFluid-immersed distribution transformers REN converts MV to LV with identical frequency Ratings: ≤ 15 MVA /  ≤ 72,5 kV \nFor your convenience, we have gathered relevant downloads in one spot.

In addition it offers voltage support by means of reactive power compensation. \nBy using a bulk number of supercapacitors, the new SVC PLUS FS® (E-STATCOM) is a cost-efficient, compact solution that can emulate system inertia by boosting high active power into the grid when needed. It also offers voltage support by means of reactive power compensation.  \n Inertia support by SVC PLUS FS®  \nSVC PLUS FS® for a stable grid \nSVC PLUS FS® for a CO₂-free power supply \nWhile grids are undergoing fundamental changes in terms of power generation, renewable infeed and ever-growing demand, power quality and dynamic grid stability are at risk due to less synchronous power generation. \nThe grid frequency is balanced to 50 Hz or 60 Hz by parity of power demand and generation. The frequency must be kept within specific limits, even in the event of an imbalance: for example, from a disturbance. After a fault, the frequency can only be stabilized by an inertial response from generator-turbine sets. The mechanical kinetic energy defines the frequency drop after disturbance until the operating reserve is activated after several seconds by the primary frequency reserve (PFR). Fewer rotating machines result in shrinking instantaneous reserves, which increases the risk of exceeding critical frequency levels. This may lead to load rejection or a blackout. Grid operators are forced to keep power plants in operation in order to preserve the instantaneous reserve or to optionally invest in additional primary reserve. Some source of fast frequency response (FFR) is urgently needed to cover the gap between inertial response and operating reserves. \nBlackout prevention \nCombining SVC PLUS FS® (modular multilevel STATCOM) and supercapacitors that allow +/–50 MW of active power output/input for up to several seconds, SVC PLUS FS® is an ideal tool for fast frequency response in the first few seconds of a major grid disturbance. \nCost-effective solution \nThe supercapacitors are the economical solution of choice to provide high power density at a space-saving footprint. Due to low losses and easy maintenance low lifetime expenditures can be achieved. \nShort response time \nThe SVC PLUS FS® is geared up for quick injection of reactive and active power and is therefore a highly dynamic solution for voltage regulation and frequency stabilization. \nHigh flexibility \nThe highly adaptable solution is suitable for various applications through the flexible adjustment of control parameters.  \nIndipendent of power generation \nNot defined as a power generating unit and therefore available to all transmission system operators who aren’t allowed to operate power-generating assets. \nEnvironmentally friendly \nSmall footprint, no local CO₂ emissions; allows more grid access for renewable power generators. \nIn challenging times like ours, grid operators need versatile resources that give them options not only to react, but to act proactively. At that, with SVC PLUS FS®, operators can be sure of a reliable, economical and space-saving solution with many advantages in terms of response time, control accuracy, and economic impact. \nWhile every power grid and every large industrial consumer has specific challenges in terms of power quality, active and reactive power compensation, and grid stability, our customized SVC PLUS FS® turnkey solutions answer these challenges from a single source, including customized consulting. \nFrom technical clarifications to on-site support and turnkey solutions, our service portfolio helps you optimize your assets and their performance throughout their entire service life – with comprehensive solutions from just one provider. \nControl & Protection (C&P) systems are key to managing power flows and protecting grid components in HVDC and FACTS plants. Both tasks have to be considered in light of increasingly complex grid architectures and fluctuating power infeed from renewable energy sources. For many Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSO), this leads to three major challenges: first, fast reaction to market needs and short lead time of the C&P system. Second, reliable and secure operations throughout the entire lifecycle while safeguarding low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). And last but not least, the C&P system should be easy to expand for new solutions and services. This is crucial in order to cope with the ongoing transformation of the energy system and to leverage the potential of future innovations. With our new modular C&P platform Grid Flow PLUS, we’re addressing all of these challenges. \nC&P platform - Grid Flow PLUS  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"SVC PLUS Frequency Stabilizer\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/svcplus-frequency-stabilizer.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Single stage radial compressors\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/single-stage-radial-compressors.html\" has the following content:\nWe offer a comprehensive range of single-stage radial compressors for applications in the metallurgical, oil and gas and chemical industries.

Using a Thermal Digital Twin based on data from the DCS for advanced control concepts without major changes to mechanical equipment is one of the options to increase your plants profitability. \nWith Omnivise Performance you can adapt plant operations to your current requirements. \nGT Auto Tuner is an AI-based solution for gas turbines that uses a digital twin to optimize the turbine inlet temperature and emissions with the help of reinforcement learning. \nThe turbine inlet temperature is estimated accurately by performing online energy balance in real time. Goal of the improved turbine inlet temperature control is to compensate the power degradation (performance recovery) in combination with a continuous real time optimization of emissions and combustor dynamics.  \nA new package of enhanced energy services from Siemens Energy will supply Dubai Electricity and Water Authority’s (DEWA) Jebel Ali L2 power and water station with the latest advancements in power plant service, maintenance, and controls. Under terms of the new long-term service agreement, Siemens Energy will supply an intelligent controller for each of the four SGT5-4000F gas turbines, the latest Omnivise T3000 control system, services for generators, as well as added upgrades for outage reduction and operational flexibility. \nGT Auto Tuner improves combustion control and further minimizes seasonal tuning by supplementing the Omnivise T3000 controls with a trained reinforcement learning control policy together with a direct engine temperature control method. \nChanges in ambient conditions and exhaust back pressure can result in different combustion visible in modified dynamics and emission levels. \nPatented reinforcement learning (RL) methods extract existent dependencies into a neural network based RL control policy that is continuously adjusting the combustion process.  \nField experience demonstrated the potential to lower NOx emissions and minimize the need for seasonal tuning based on the combination of AI and improved turbine inlet temperature estimation.  \nVolkmar Sterzing and Steffen Udluft of Siemens Energy Corporate Technology developed a process that uses just a few recorded data to teach machines to regulate complex processes on their own. The continuous fine-tuning of the combustion valves has optimized gas turbine operations in terms of emissions and wear by constantly searching for the best solution in real time. \nBefore it went into practical use, Volkmar Sterzing and the team at the Berlin gas turbine plant thoroughly tested the GT Auto Tuner. \nThe scope includes the control logic that is required for autonomous optimization. Depending on individual project requirements, it can also include controls hardware as well as additional instrumentation.  \nThe Stability/Emissions Functionality autonomously introduces refinements to the fuel distribution and outlet temperature control in order to drive emissions and combustion dynamics towards optimal values in both steady state and transient operation. \nIt allows real time combustion tuning by fuel staging optimization and continuously optimized fuel fraction control for the given load.  \nThis autonomous combustion control helps to significantly reduce NOₓ emissions.  \nThe Performance Functionality allows real time gas turbine performance modelling to improve engine performance by compensating detrimental effects to temperature control set point (OTC). \nThis partial degradation recovery functionality integrates physics-based Real Time Thermal Modeling (RTTM), a software library calculating turbine inlet temperature (TIT) in real time on site. Adjustments are made autonomously at baseload to maintain the RTTM-calculated TIT to the predefined TIT set point.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"GT Auto Tuner\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/gt-autotuner.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"BlueWind\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/bluewind.html\" has the following content:\nDecarbonizing offshore energy systems for generations to come \nThe primary objective is to improve the efficiency of power generation, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint from the offshore production unit. The solution is based on the simple principle utilizing individual or multiple Offshore Floating Wind Units (OFWUs) equipped with battery energy storage and grid converters connecting to the oil and gas asset. When tied together, the OFWUs can be used to create offshore microgrids capable of supplying emissions-free power to offshore Oil and Gas facilities that rely on fossil-fuel based power generation from gas turbines or gas/diesel gensets. \nDecarbonizing our energy systems is the biggest undertaking of our generation – and cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions in offshore production is part of it. \nSiemens Energy has developed the BlueWind solution, which will substantially increase and improve the performance of the offshore floating wind turbines connected to oil and gas assets for decreasing the emissions by allowing switching off completely the gas turbines on the assets. The battery energy storage and the Power Management System (PMS) solve this issue by always ensuring grid stability, so that the full extent of power generating from the wind turbine(s) can be harnessed. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"BlueWind\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/bluewind.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Integrated Electrolyzer & Heat Pump Solution\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/integrated-electrolyzer-heat-pump-solution.html\" has the following content:\nBoost the efficiency of hydrogen production while decarbonizing district heating: For the production of green hydrogen, typically 70-80% of the electrical energy is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, while the rest is converted into waste heat. With our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution, we combine the production of hydrogen and heat: The heat pump dissipates the waste heat from the electrolyzer, raises its temperature to a higher level and makes it available for other processes, such as district heating. By removing waste heat, the heat pump also provides cooling for the electrolyzer, minimizing the need for other cooling equipment.  Click on the plus buttons below to explore more about our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDiscover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video! \nElyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors. \nWith our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition. The \"P\" denotes Proton Exchange Membrane technology. \nOur proven solutions remain unchanged, supporting efficient production of green hydrogen. \nWith our new name, we strengthen our position as a leading provider in this important field and invite you to become part of the hydrogen revolution. \nLowering hydrogen production cost (LCoH) \nDecarbonizing district heating at competitive price \nShorten Return on Invest (ROI) time for hydrogen and heat production solution \nWhenever enough renewable energy is available, it can be used to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen can be easily stored for times when there is a shortage of renewable energy. At the same time, the heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer to produce heat at temperatures suitable for district heating. In times of renewable energy surplus, thermal power plants can be shut down because they are not needed for electricity or heat production. When heat production is higher than heat demand, the excess heat from the heat pump can be stored in thermal storage facilities. \nThese processes are working together for our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution. \nDuring periods of renewable energy shortage and high energy prices, the hydrogen can be fired in a thermal plant (e.g., a hydrogen-ready gas turbine cogeneration plant) to produce electricity and heat. The heat from the thermal storage covers periods of high heat demand but low electricity demand. The integration of renewable energy in heat production helps to decarbonize district heating. The integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution lowers the levelized cost of energy for both hydrogen production and heat production for district heating by minimizing energy losses.  \nElectrolyzer provides an efficiency of about 75%. An integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution increases energy utilization. This calculation is based on a solution with hydrogen production of 1005 kg/h at 80 barg with a heat pump for district heating as mentioned in the table below. Please follow the power flows of the process in the diagram. The energy utilization is increased up to 96% and more. \nAn integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solution consists of the PEM electrolyzer (standard configuration for 335 kg/h and 1005 kg/h hydrogen are available), a high-temperature heat pump (8 MWth or 24 MWth; max. achievable temperature for district heating: up to 150°C), the control system and hydrogen as well as heat storage. \nClick on the plus icons to learn more about the different component of our integrated electrolyzer and heat pump solutions \nPower-fully efficient \nWaste heat should not be wasted! Our solution increases the energy utilization of green hydrogen production from 75% to 96% or more. The heat pump uses the waste heat from the electrolyzer. It raises the temperature level and makes it usable for processes such as district heating. \nPower-fully intelligent \nOur solution provides automated and optimized operation through intelligent control that can manage energy supply and demand for electricity and heat, as well as reserve management. It uses real-time data in an autonomous and coordinated manner to ensure reliable 24/7 operation. \nPower-fully sustainable \nIntegrating renewable energy into heat production decarbonizes district heating. It helps to reduce emissions and meet decarbonization targets. With the integration of hydrogen and heat storage, improved operational flexibility and reliability of the energy system could be an additional benefit. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Integrated Electrolyzer & Heat Pump Solution\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/integrated-electrolyzer-heat-pump-solution.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"AM Projects at Werner-von-Siemens-Centre\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/am-projects-at-werner-von-siemens-center.html\" has the following content:\nFocussing on change in production technology  \nTwo new AM research projects, High Temperature Applications (HTA) 2.0 and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) 2.0, have been officially kicked-off in summer 2020 and, besides all odds of the pandemic crisis, are successfully reporting the first milestones already.        \nThe R&D projects address key developments on AM for new designs of gas turbine components and hybrid blade repair. \nAim of the research project: Development of new additive manufacturing processes and components for high-temperature components in large gas turbines, taking into account sustainable product development. \nScope \nThe technology fields of the project include various additive processes and materials, as an extension of the 1st phase, as well as the consideration of the efficient post-processing of AM components, e.g., robot-supported. The developed Design for Additive Manufacturing method will also be supplemented by the other AM processes and integrated into a software environment.

Due to the fact that conventional power plants are shut down, synchronous condenser solutions use a conventional generator to provide the necessary inertia and short-circuit contribution by means of its rotating mass while also providing or absorbing reactive power.  \nA synchronous condenser provides short-circuit power, inertia, and reactive power for dynamic loads. Siemens Energy supplies a broad range of generators up to 1,300 MVA at full speed. \nNew ways to balance the grid  \nSynchronous condensers solve challenges \nInertia and short-circuit power are key elements of grid stability – yet their availability is shrinking. This is caused by the addition of renewables-based power generation to the energy mix, phase-out of thermal power plants, new HVDC systems, and the extension of power supply systems to remote areas. All of this influences the stability of transmission networks, resulting in a worldwide renaissance of the synchronous condenser. The Siemens Energy synchronous condenser solution comprises a horizontal synchronous generator connected to the high-voltage transmission network via a step-up transformer. It is started up and stopped with a frequency-controlled electric motor (pony motor) or a starting frequency converter. When the generator has reached operating synchronous speed, it will be synchronized with the transmission network, and the machine is operated as a motor providing reactive and short-circuit power to the transmission network. \nContribution of short-circuit power \nAfter the generator is synchronized with the network it behaves like a synchronous motor with no load, providing short-circuit power to the transmission network. \nVoltage support \nThe generator is connected to the transmission network through a transformer. Either a pony motor or a static frequency converter starts it and provides reactive power when it’s synchronous to the system frequency.  \nShort-term overload capability \nDuring emergencies or contingencies the synchronous condenser can provide a significantly higher rating for a short time, depending on its specifications. \nInertia to the transmission system \nThe generator provides the necessary inertia by means of its rotating mass while also providing or absorbing reactive power. \nOur synchronous condenser solutions use a generator to provide the necessary inertia with its rotating mass while also providing or absorbing reactive power. The generator is connected to the transmission network by a transformer, and is started by either an electric motor or a static frequency converter. Once operating speed is achieved, the generator is synchronized with the network and behaves like a synchronous motor with no load, providing reactive power and shortcircuit power to the transmission network. \nTo provide maximum inertia, Siemens Energy has extended the established synchronous condensers solution with additional rotating mass from a flywheel. This extension is a very effective method to maintain the required level of inertia and thus the RoCoF (Rate of change of frequency) of the system. Rotating mass provides an inherent synchronous inertia response (SIR), what is counteracting grid frequency fluctuations with active power injection or absorption during sudden load unbalance events. \nSiemens Energy’s flywheels are operated in partial vacuum to minimize air friction losses and reduce the cooling efforts to maintain required temperature level in all operational and emergency modes. The design enables a safe emergency run-down in case of total power loss (grid black-out). The flywheel is designed for plug & play installation delivered to the site with rotor installed, lowest possible footprint and low supervision and maintenance effort. \nOne of our current projects - Rassau: turnkey solution synchronous condenser with Flywheel \nSynchronous condensers help to drive the decarbonization journey for power assets. With the rising adoption of renewable energy, traditional power generation methods are utilized less, and generators are being shut down. A Brownfield rotating grid stabilizer conversion not only enables a rising share of renewable infeed on the grid but also provides a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to a new build. \nTwo become one: Siemens Energy combines two technologies to stabilize the Irish grid \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Synchronous condenser (SC)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/synchronous-condenser.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Instrumentation & Controls\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/service/instrumentation-controls.html\" has the following content:\nEver tougher competition is forcing power generators to identify and leverage every possible improvement no matter how small: every gain adds a little more to overall plant efficiency.

First up for migration is always the HMI level: HMI functions are updated with the Omnivise T3000 design (look and feel) based on new device technology while retaining as many components as possible from your existing I&C installation. Your existing HMI components are replaced with an Omnivise T3000 application server and thin clients in the course of the migration process, still your proven plant configurations and settings remain. The second step, which can be implemented whenever you are ready, involves the migration of the automation platform. Cabinets, PCB assemblies and dedicated l.v. wiring are retained. The basic control engineering data from SPPA-T2000 is captured by a special tool in a largely automated procedure and then converted for Omnivise T3000. \nI&C migration \nNaturally, we can also offer you solutions for the migration of your electrical system components. Tailored solutions for the modernization of the eBoP requirement in power plants help to bring about a more homogeneous electrical and I&C system landscape.

That makes mechanically switched capacitors (MSC) and mechanically switched reactors (MSR) the most economical power compensation devices for mainly constant or predictable voltage. Both devices are connected to the grid via high-voltage circuit breakers. Under heavy load conditions, MSCs provide voltage control and grid stabilization in a simple and cost-efficient way. MSRs provide stability under low load conditions or can be used at the end of long, radial AC lines. However, usage is somewhat limited as the capacitors need to discharge for several minutes after switching off an MSC bank. Filter circuits are often used in industrial plants. The filter circuits damp the generated harmonics which are produced by inverters and nonlinear loads. The MSCDN additionally offers a damping network to avoid resonance conditions in the electrical system.  \nSimple and most economical: mechanically switched capacitors (MSC), mechanically switched reactors (MSR) or filter circuits (FC) are well proven in many applications. \nWhen speed is not the main focus, mechanically switched capacitors (MSC) are a simple and low-speed solution that provides grid stabilization and voltage control under heavy load conditions, while mechanically switched reactors (MSR) provide stabilization under low load conditions. \nA more advanced variant is a mechanically switched capacitor with damping network (MSCDN). This filter circuit provides reactive power to the grid by using a capacitive filter structure. This limits the amplification of existing harmonics in the grid, and further enhances grid stability. In industrial plants filter circuits reduce harmonics and improve the power factor. Switched filters enable a slow power factor control. \nCompact design \nThe simple and effective compensation method for the grid makes possible the compact design to fit in limited space. \nCost-effective solution \nMechanically switched capacitors (MSC), mechanically switched reactors (MSR) or filter circuits (FC) are both proven solutions for fairly constant or predictable voltage or reactive power profiles. \nTransient and harmonic damping \nA capacitive filter structure enables the mechanically switched capacitor with damping network (MSCDN) to damp existing harmonics and transients for example from switching events. \nIncreasing voltage through mechanically switched capacitors (MSC) or switched filter circuits (FC) \nMechanically switched capacitors (MSC) or filter circuits (FC) allow automatic switching of the capacitor banks according to the requirement of the network system and can also be switched on and off manually. MSC increase voltage at the point of connection.  \nDecreasing voltage through mechanically switched reactor (MSR) \nMechanically switched reactors (MSR) have the opposite effect of mechanically switched capacitors. MSR therefore decrease voltage at the point of connection. \nFiltering harmful frequencies through mechanically switched capacitors with damping network (MSCDN) or filter circuits (FC) \nMSCDN and FC provide reactive power to the grid through a capacitive filter structure. It provides capacitive reactive power under power frequency conditions. When its tuning frequency is exceeded, the MSCDN has an inductive behavior. At high-frequency conditions it acts as a damping resistor. Filter circuits are specific designed in order to damp the harmonics on its junction point. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Mechanically switched capacitor\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/msc-mscdn.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Green hydrogen production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/hydrogen-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nGreen hydrogen (H2) is a versatile energy carrier that can be applied to decarbonize a wide range of sectors. It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas. Only around 40% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from power generation which can be decarbonized via electrification. The other 60% of CO2 emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be decarbonized via sector coupling, using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition. \nDiscover the new name of our electrolysis portfolio by watching the video! \nElyzer is designed for industrial-scale applications of renewable hydrogen in both industry and mobility sectors. \nWith our product, Elyzer P-300, we emphasize our innovative strength and commitment to scaling the hydrogen economy within the energy transition.

As a molecule (H2), it occurs only in small amounts in nature and it is mainly chemically bound, such as H2O. \nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. 90 percent of all atoms are hydrogen atoms. They add up to three quarters of the total mass in the universe. \nHydrogen converts into a liquid at minus 253 ºC. \nHydrogen has the highest energy density of all conventional fuels by mass: almost three times as high as that of gasoline or diesel. That is one of the reasons why hydrogen is used as fuel for space travel. \nH2 Higher  Heating  Value: 39.4 kWh/kg; H2 Lower Heating  Value: 33.3 kWh/kg \nBy combusting hydrogen, it delivers heat. Used in fuel cells, hydrogen is converted electrochemically  to electrical energy. \nHydrogen has been produced and used for more than 200 years. Experience shows that hydrogen can be stored, distributed and converted safely. As early as 1808, the first large-scale use of hydrogen was established for the street lighting system in London. \nHydrogen (H2) can be produced in different ways. For the moment more than 95% of the hydrogen worldwide is produced from hydrocarbons while producing and emitting harmful CO2. A more modern and ecofriendly technology for CO2 neutral production of hydrogen can be offered by electrolysis of water. \nHydrogen can be produced from hydrocarbons by steam reforming of natural gas - often referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR), coal gasification and from an electrolysis process of water (H2O). \nHydrogen can be stored in tanks as a compressed gas or as a liquid. Hydrogen can also be stored in caverns or in the natural gas grid for different applications and if the grid fulfils all technological requirements. \nThe volumetric energy density of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is approximately one third of traditional fuels. The volumetric energy density can be increased by compression or liquefaction of the hydrogen gas to store and transport a greater amount of hydrogen. \nFor hydrogen-powered vehicles, an industry standard of 300 to 700 bar has been established. Vehicles for the transport of compressed hydrogen, so called “tankers”, usually working with a maximum pressure of 200 bar. \nHydrogen can be transported as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid. Today, the two main methods for transporting hydrogen (primarily in a gaseous state) are via tanker e.g. tube trailer for road transportation and in gas pipelines (for short distance). \nHydrogen is a non-toxic clear gas. It is not poisonous, has no taste or odor. Using hydrogen as a fuel source with fuel cells does not create fumes, pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide or emit nitrogen oxides. \nIt is not inherently more dangerous than other fuel sources.  Hydrogen is flammable and must be handled with care, just like other flammable fuels. To ignite, the hydrogen must be combined with an additional oxidizing agent (air, pure oxygen, chlorine, etc.) in a specific  concentration and an ignition source (a spark). If, in a worst-case scenario, the hydrogen ignites, it burns upwards very quickly. It creates no dangerous heat radiation above the accident site, as petrol or kerosene do. \nThe facilities are designed to be permanently leak proof. Flange connections are designed especially for hydrogen and the number of detachable connections are minimized. Furthermore, in buildings a steady air exchange is ensured and the facilities are equipped with safety valves and pressure reliefs. Additionally explosion prevention zones are designated. In these zones, electrical and other equipment needs to be in accordance with 2014/34/EU (ATEX Directive). \nNo. Hydrogen can be safely handled and stored as well as transported. The industrial gas industry has done so for over a century. \nIn contrast to gasoline and natural gas, hydrogen gas has significant buoyancy in atmospheric conditions due to its low density, any leaking hydrogen gas ascends immediately and disperses, which reduces the risk of an ignition in open air. \nWater gets split into its components hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrical current. \nElectrolysis processes can be categorized as follows: alkaline electrolysis with liquid alkaline electrolytes, acidic electrolysis with a solid polymer electrolyte (as PEM) and high temperature electrolysis with a solid oxide as electrolyte. \nPEM electrolysis and alkaline electrolysis systems are available at an industrial scale. The solid oxide electrolysis technology is in an early development phase. \nPEM is the abbreviation for proton exchange membrane. This membrane is a crucial part of the electrolytic cell in a PEM-electrolyzer. The membrane separates the anode, where the oxygen is collected, and the cathode, where the hydrogen gas is generated. \nThe type of the ions which closes the electric circuit \n10 liter demineralized water is needed for 1kg of hydrogen. \nOn average 50kWh are necessary to produce 1kg of hydrogen, depending on the efficiency of the electrolyzer and operation mode. \nThe hydrogen market is divided in three sectors. Mobility, energy and industry with industry being by far the largest consumer today (~90%). In the future a redistribution towards the mobility and energy sector is expected . \nToday, hydrogen is an important industrial gas, i.e. for the refining of fuels, for the production of fertilizer and methanol, for the hydrogenation of fats, for steel production, metal processing, as well as in the production of flat glass. \nLess than 1kg of hydrogen is needed per 100km. \nPassenger car or light duty vehicle fueling takes 3 to 5 minutes. \nHydrogen enables the long-term storage of large quantities of surplus renewable energy. It is allows new ways to use green electricity, i.e. by using hydrogen as substitute for natural gas by feeding it into existing pipelines, as fuel for fuel-cell vehicles or power plants, or as feedstock for the hydrogen processing industry. It opens the possibility to connect energy generation with the industry and mobility sectors, the so called “sector coupling”. \nNo. Hydrogen will become a substantial and permanent element of a sustainable energy industry. \nIn the future, hydrogen will be produced to a greater extent using electricity from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, biogas and various fuels like solid biomass will help to produce green hydrogen in the future. \n‘Green’ hydrogen is sourced by 100% renewable energy. That means that the needed energy to produce hydrogen by electrolysis has emitted zero emissions. Hydrogen produced from fossil fuels releasing emissions such as CO2, may be referred to as ‘grey’ or ‘brown’ hydrogen. If the emitted carbon dioxide is captured, stored (carbon capture storage) and re-used, it is often called ‘blue’ hydrogen. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Green hydrogen production\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/hydrogen-solutions.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"SGen-3000W generator series\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/sgen-3000w.html\" has the following content:\nHigh-power generator with proven water/hydrogen cooling technology \nOur latest water-/hydrogen-cooled generators benefit from proven design and technologies as well as the application of our building-block approach.

Advancements in technology, the falling cost of digitalization, and the connectivity of smart devices provide a real competition-beating opportunity for oil and gas companies who play the digital revolution right. The potential benefits of going digital are increased productivity, shorter response and intervention times, cost savings, safer operations, and asset integrity as well as sustainable resource treatment. \nAbout 40 percent of global crude oil and natural gas production comes from mature fields that have been in operation for more than 25 years. In fact, there are about 175 fields that have been producing for more than 100 years. Oil and gas operators are increasingly investing in so-called artificial lift systems to keep production high at the end of a field’s life. This is where the SIWELL Artificial Lift suite comes in – a scalable, end-to-end IoT solution for the automation and optimization of artificial lift systems. It is designed to optimize production and reduce costs through connected systems, automation, edge analytics, and artificial intelligence. With the latest Siemens edge technology, analytics and intelligence are moving close to the field where the artificial lifts are operating.  SIWELL uses existing sensors and smart automation components as key inputs for edge data analytics. \nThe edge computing device, the Siemens Nanobox, performs real-time processing of the data and enables advanced features like video processing, soft sensing for the replacement of physical sensors, simulation of production facilities, and calculation of advanced KPIs. Performing these calculations at the pump enables independent operation of the well with a minimum of maintenance effort at the well site. Alarm functions with video integration are available and can be accessed via a fully interactive web portal. This innovation offers oil and gas operators a cost-efficient solution to automate and connect artificial lift systems to an integrated network with minimal effort, while providing a high level of automation. The plug-and-play concept in combination with centralized device management can be installed within hours, thus reducing downtimes for commissioning and enabling the centralized management and monitoring of thousands of wells. \nArtificial intelligence in the cloud enables predictive maintenance and increases performance \nThe solution is tightly integrated with the Siemens MindSphere IoT platform, which connects real things to the digital world and enables powerful industry applications and digital services. It connects production facilities and applications for advanced analytics of multiple wells. Artificial intelligence can be applied to predict failures of the well days before they occur and increases the overall performance of oilfields by optimizing operational set points like pumping speed. \nDr. Helmut Schnabl, principal consultant for digital oil and gas at Siemens Energy  \nOptimizing production from mature oilfields \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"SIWELL Artificial Lift Suite \" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/siwell-artificial-lift-suite.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Omnivise electrical solutions\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/omnivise-digital-solutions/omnivise-electrical-solutions.html\" has the following content:\nElectrical systems within a plant are its life force \nWell-maintained, modernized systems optimize efficiencies and lower costs.

Insulator flashovers, voltage dips and interruptions are prevented by eliminating all lightning and switching overvoltages above the insulator insulation level (the lightning-impulse withstand level, or LIWL for short). \nInstallation of line surge arresters at recommended locations along the line in accordance with our line simulation ensures anhanced overvoltage protection. Selecting the optimum line surge arresters, especially in terms of their quantity and installation locations, significantly improves the reliability of the overall line system and the quality of power that it supplies. We offer line surge arresters for system voltages up to 800 kV and an energy discharge capability of 3.6 C. \n Benefits: \nIn case of lightning, the spark gap flashes over and the arrester limits the ground fault current from several kA to a few amperes, and extinguishes the arc within 10 ms such that no circuit breaker operation at both line ends is needed, i.e. no reclosing operation. \nBenefits: \nSiemens Energy optionally offers software analysis (simulation) based on Cigré studies to examine and conduct preliminary tests of customer-specific applications as a way of determining the optimal, cost-effective solution. With this approach, the customer only needs to equip particular phases or individual line segments with line surge arresters, and can still ensure sufficient lightning protection of the overhead line. \nIn the first phase of an analysis, all important parameters of the transmission line under study are entered into the simulation software, and the installations to be examined are selected.

Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct.  \nWhile we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear. \nThe only way to achieve Zero GWP and zero toxicity is by using clean air. Gas-insulated switchgear combine vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance. \nEnabling higher voltage levels ​for wind turbines​. It is essential to live energy transition and increase resource efficiency. ​Wind power generation is making a major contribution for the  growing power demand and a new generation of wind power plants require innovative technologies. ​Our compact, environmentally friendly, high-voltage gas-insulated 8VM1 Blue GIS for on- & offshore installations up to 72.5 kV is an optimal contribution to enlarged wind turbine power and reduced cable losses. \nThe 8VN1 Blue GIS maintains the highest standards of performance and reliability. It delivers high voltages with the highest switching performance without degradation, and is capable of operating in extreme environmental conditions across the globe. 8VN1 is compatible with all previously installed conventional GIS of the same voltage level and saves more than 80% CO2 equivalent over the entire product life cycle. ​The usage of the new Low Power Instrument Transformer (LPIT) reduces the bay length by 30% and weight by 25% which saves even more CO2. \nAlso in higher voltages from 245 – 420 kV an SF6 reduction is possible. A combined solution of a conventional GIS together with our Blue GIB saves between 30 – 65% SF6. At the same time, it maintains the highest standards of technical performance and reliability, together with low lifecycle costs. No specially trained personnel is needed for the transport, handling, or operation of the clean air GIB for 420 kV.  \nLPITs are innovative voltage and current transformers providing a safe, reliable and standardized solution for measurement and protection applications in GIS. \nZero SF6 and other F-gasesZero greenhouse gas emissionsZero GWP\n \nZero toxic insulation gasesZero toxic decomposition productsZero special safety measures needed during maintenanceZero regulations on handling of gasZero disposal of gases required at end of life\n \nZero reporting and accounting of gases requiredZero issues with current and potential legislation against F-gases\n \nVoltages from 72.5 to 145 kVHigh number of short-circuit and rated current interruptionsTwo-cycle current interruptionFull performance down to -60°C ambient temperatureMaintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime10+ years of experience in HV vacuum switching\n \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan.\nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nWhile high-voltage equipment often outlasts its warranty periods, our team of over 2,000 Siemens Energy employees worldwide is ready to support your equipment throughout its entire lifespan. \nWe ensure optimal performance, high availability, and efficiency for your GIS, providing a secure and stable power supply for many years. \nThe 8VM1 Blue GIS® is now certified to withstand real earthquake conditions. The qualification level was tested “high”, which ensures structural integrity and continuous functionality during highest loads. \nResilience for high-voltage equipment: An 8VN1 Blue GIS typical bay for the 145 kV level successfully passed seismic qualification shake-table tests in line with IEEE 693 high level specifications. Neither the specimen nor the support structure sustained any structural damage or suffered from impaired functionality as a result of the tests. \nCerius is the first utility in Denmark to order a Clean Air insulated switchgear with vacuum switching technology. \nNetze BW, Burladingen, Germany \nSiemens Energy has delivered more than 4000 units of sustainable transformers and gasinsulated switchgear for the installation in the nacelles and towers of offshore wind parks. This is an important contribution to the expansion of renewable energy sources, which is in line with the outcome of the latest world energy forum report. Besides, it supports the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  \nSiemens Energy has been awarded the contract to deliver ten bays of Blue gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) to Fingrid, Finland’s transmission system operator. It will be the first GIS in Finland that replaces F-gases with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with zero potential for global warming. This will be the most significant Blue installation to date. \nYou can find informational materials on our gas-insulated switchgear here. \nCustomer Support Center \nCustomer support center  \nRegister for upcoming events & webinars \nSiemens Energy fairs, events & webinars \nSiemens Energy Downloads \nWhitepapers & Recordings \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Gas-insulated switchgear\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/gas-insulated-switchgear.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Sensproducts: Born digital\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/sensproducts.html\" has the following content:\nThe role of digitalization in energy transmission and distribution is becoming increasingly significant due to the growing complexity of grid structures and the rising importance of environmental compatibility.

Today, more than 2,200 units have been installed globally proving their worth with a wide reference base in a wide range of industries and applications such as air separation and CO2 compression. \nIntegrally geared compressors are multi-shaft machines. Several pinion shafts with one or two impellers each are arranged around a central bull gear. For each pinion shaft a perfect combination of shaft speed and impeller size can be realized. All impellers are of overhung design and can be fitted with adjustable inlet guide vanes in front of each impeller. Inter-stage cooling of the gas stream can be done after each impeller discharge. The combination of these features allows for high volume flows, outstanding energy efficiency even under part load, all in a compact design. \nFor small- to medium-size compressor sizes, Siemens Energy offers a package design. The package can include the compressor, driver, process gas coolers, lube oil console, process piping, and all tubing and wiring. The package design leads to significantly reduced on-site installation time. For large-size units all main train components are delivered separately to site to be installed on a concrete foundation. \nGeared for success - Exploring integrally geared compressors \nIn this webinar series our experts discuss integrally geared compressors and their applications, providing you with a deeper understanding of this compression technology and the advancements shaping the industry. \nOur customized line of integrally geared machines can accommodate up to four pinion shafts with up to eight impellers total resulting in impressive pressure ratios which can be achieved in a compact design. Compressors can be designed according to API 617 or API 672 and customer specifications. Driver options depend on process and energy resources and can be electric motor, steam turbine or gas turbine and are suitable for direct turbine-drive or even integrated expansion turbine design. \nA variant of the customized integrally geared compressor allows the integration of a single- or two-stage radial expansion turbine as a direct drive option for the compressor. This allows the direct recovery and conversion of energy from pressurized high temperature process gas streams into kinetic energy driving the compressor. Depending on the amount of available energy, this drive option can serve as sole drive, or as drive in combination with other drive options such as electric motor or steam turbine.   \nOur standardized designs come with up to two pinion shafts with one or two impellers each. Standardized integrally geared machines come in two groups of frame sizes for 10,000-100,000 and 120,000-400,000m3/h capacity. These product lines are standardized versions of the customized integrally geared compressor series, the trusty workhorse of the air separation and process industry. The high degree of standardization results in lower capital costs and shorter delivery times as compared with fully customized compressors. \nThe first group is available in nine frames (sizes 10-100) for volume flow rates between 10,000 and 100,000m3/h and can be packaged as compact single-lift units.  \nThe second group extends the available range of volume flow rates to between 120,000–400,000m3/h capacities with additional five frame sizes (165-400). Eighty percent of the machine is pre-engineered for consistency and repeatability. 20 percent of the machine can be customized for specific customer process needs.  \nOur single stage centrifugal compressor is the perfect fit for atmospheric air compression at low pressure ratios. It covers a large flow range from small to very high volumes of up to 1.000.000 m3/h. This compressor uses well proven components from our integral geared compressor line and is designed in accordance with API 617. State-of-the-art aerodynamic parts allow a compact, single stage design. If necessary, an external gear box is used to match the driver speed. This modular design offers the advantage of an unchanged compressor design irrespective whether the machine is driven by a steam turbine, gas turbine or electric motor. \nOur single stage overhung compressor boasts a simple and robust design with well referenced components, smaller dimensions and less weight at the highest efficiency level, and low maintenance requirements. \nIn case of higher pressure ratio requirements, the configuration comprises two single stage overhung machines driven by a double-ended steam turbine drive between the compressors. \nProven high and low temperature industrial heat pumps for up to 150°C and 70 MWth Find out more about our large-scale industrial heat pumps. \nSteam Compression The technology that we apply for steam compression is integrally geared compressors. Read more in the article here. Decarbonizing industrial process heat through steam compression \nTurbo Heater Our Turbo Heater technology is specifically designed to deliver high-temperature process heat at industrial scale without combustion of fossil fuels.  \nDownload the flyer here. \nLooking for an efficient and cost-effective way to recover waste heat in your industrial processes? For waste heat temperature levels from approximately 70°C (i.e. mid-temperature levels), MVR cycles provide an alternative to closed loop heat pumps for recovering waste heat, to produce low, medium, or high-pressure steam. \nMVR cycles use advanced compression technology to extract heat from industrial processes and convert it into usable energy. This technology is particularly useful for the downstream oil and gas, chemicals, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and aluminum industries, where waste heat is a byproduct of many processes. \nWith MVR cycles, thermal energy from a mid-temperature waste stream is used to directly evaporate feedwater. The steam is then compressed to the required temperature and pressure level of the process. The entire latent heat for evaporation is provided by the free-of-charge waste heat. Only the sensible heat, which is significantly lower than the latent/evaporation heat, is provided in the form of compression. The steam can then be used for industrial purposes, either as a feedstock or as a heating medium, e.g. in the chemical industry or in pulp and paper. \nFor application cases in which waste steam is present at lower than desired pressure levels, the steam can simply be compressed up to higher pressure and temperature levels, with the use of our multi-stage integrally geared steam compressors. \nBenefits:  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Integrally Geared Compressors\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/integrally-geared-centrifugal-compressors.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Electrical balance of plant (Omnivise electrical solutions)\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/omnivise-digital-solutions/omnivise-electrical-solutions/electricals-ebop.html\" has the following content:\nAs a solution supplier, we provide electrical integrated solutions covering the entire cycle of projects, from design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, factory test, transport, installation, commissioning, and services.​ We combine our own product portfolio with products from well-known manufacturers to design the best solution for your application.

High-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems are becoming more and more important in the global energy landscape which is characterized by increased digitalization, accelerated decarbonization and the unprecedented uptake of distributed energy resources (DER), inverter based resources (IBR) and distributed power generation in general.  \nHVDC PLUS® technology is a most efficient solution to transmit large amounts of power across long distances, facilitate the integration of renewable power resources and provide enhanced control features to stabilize the grid together with our leading portfolio of FACTS & storage solutions. \nHVDC PLUS®  addresses many of today's challenges to make the energy transition happen on a global scale. Its adoption not only signifies an important step towards achieving sustainability goals but also delivers tangible benefits ranging from operational efficiencies for TSOs to environmental conservation efforts benefiting society at large. As we continue to transition and seek ways to make our electrical transmission grids smarter and more resilient, embracing technologies like HVDC PLUS® will be key to energize society and create a more sustainable future for all. \nThe answer to new challenges in AC grids & complex transmission systems \nHVDC PLUS® technology is ideally suited to support and improve sustainability, efficiency, and reliability of electrical transmission grids. HVDC transmission systems supplement the existing AC grid and enable the following applications: \nMost efficient for long-distance power transmission \nConnecting remote renewable generation or remote loads to the interconnected AC grid for performance improvements \nIntegration of renewables & provision of energy trading capabilities \nEmbedded HVDC links in interconnected AC grids & large city center infeed \nProviding fully controllable active & reactive power supply in both directions \nConnection of asynchronous grids / grids with different frequencies and firewall against cascading blackouts \nAs a pioneer in HVDC technology, Siemens Energy provides a comprehensive portfolio of efficient and sustainable HVDC solutions in all fields of application for HVDC PLUS® technology. \nSymmetric Monopole \nThe HVDC PLUS® symmetric monopole configuration is a foundational design configuration in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, characterized by its superior simplicity and reliability. \nIn this setup, the HVDC converter is connected with fully insulated DC conductors, operating at equal but opposite DC voltages to ground and offers the following main advantages: \nBipole \nThe bipole configurations represent a logical evolution and up-scaling in HVDC PLUS® technology which provides greater capacity and flexibility compared to symmetric monopole configurations. \nThere are three main types: \nPoint-to-Point HVDC  \nPoint-to-point HVDC transmission involves two converter stations connecting two grid connection points directly using an DC transmission line in between. \nThis set-up is ideal for long-distance energy transmission between two specific locations using DC cable or DC OHL systems. \nIt's widely used for cross-border interconnections and connecting remote renewable energy sources to major consumption centers. Siemens Energy is the most experienced trusted partner to make cutting-edge and most reliable point-to-point HVDC transmission schemes a reality. \nBack-to-Back \nA back-to-back HVDC PLUS® system consists of two converter stations located in close proximity, usually within the same building, converting AC power from one network frequency directly into another network frequency via HVDC without any actual DC transmission line involved. \nThis setup is utilized primarily for connecting asynchronous electrical grids efficiently while also providing advanced control capabilities  for active & reactive power as well as AC voltage control. \nMultiterminal HVDC \nMultiterminal HVDC PLUS® systems build upon point-to-point concepts by incorporating more than two converter stations in a single integrated HVDC system with multiple converter stations and multiple DC transmission lines. \nThis enables more flexible and more complex power transmission opportunities such as collecting power from multiple generation sites (e.g., offshore wind farms, remote renewable energy sources) and distributing it across various load centers efficiently through strategic routing decisions made possible by advanced control systems inherent within specific and custom tailor-made multiterminal HVDC designs. \nThese set-ups enable  increased flexibility in integrating multiple renewable sources into a single integrated HVDC system enhancing grid efficiency and footprint. It allows for dynamic rerouting of energy based on generation and/or demand fluctuations ensuring optimal utilization of power resources available across regions. \nA key component which facilitates these advanced capabilities of multiterminal HVDC systems is the converter technology used – specifically, half-bridge and full-bridge converters. Each offers unique advantages and characteristics suited to different operational / performance requirements. \nSiemens Energy vast experience from 15 successfully executed point-to-point HVDC systems showcases the reliability and capability of Siemens  Energy as a most reliable  and most trusted partner in the industry making complex multiterminal HVDC systems a reality. \nSiemens Energy leverages decades of HVDC expertise & modular multilevel converter technology to its fullest capabilities, applying half-bridge as well as full-bridge  converters. If required parallel converters can be used for increased power transmission capabilities and  provide superior redundancy and unmatched flexibility. \nOutstanding technological advantages for AC grid support  \nThe well-proven & established industry standard for VSC-based HVDC solutions \nThe Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) technology was first introduced to the market by Siemens Energy in 2007. It was successfully commissioned and put into commercial operation in 2010 with the pivotal pilot project Transbay Cable (San Francisco, USA). \nEventhough several other HVDC converter concepts were tested and trialed in the late 1990s/early 2000s all alternative HVDC converter concepts were abandoned & vanished from the HVDC market landscape. \nToday MMC technology is the well-proven & established industry standard for VSC-based HVDC systems worldwide. Siemens Energy is the #1 market leader and trailblazer of MMC-based HVDC systems. \nBenefit from our project experience and proven technology \nWith over 50 years of experience, Siemens Energy is a globally renowned technology partner for HVDC systems and a most trusted partner in the industry to make even the most complex HVDC projects a reality. \nUp to his date, Siemens Energy is counting more than 70 projects among its HVDC references, in over 25 countries around the globe. This is a testament to cutting-edge HVDC technology provided worldwide making Siemens Energy a preferred global partner of choice for HVDC projects. \n43 HVDC Classic® projects are designed to operate with line-commutated converters (LCC / Thyristor technology).

To achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP), it's essential we make the transmission of power as clean and green as its generation. This means eliminating F-gases from electrical switchgear – particularly SF6, a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2. \nOur Blue portfolio uses clean air and vacuum switching technology instead. Zero F-gases, Zero toxicity and Zero harm to human health and the environment. \nLess global warming potential is not good enough. It has to be Zero, because 1% global warming potential is still global warming potential. It has to be Zero and it has to be now. \nNikola Jankulovski \nSiemens Energy Project Lead \nWe’ve recently invested €60 million in our Berlin facility to step up production of vacuum interrupters for our Blue portfolio. This will help to secure our supply chain – and since the plant uses 100% renewable energy, it will also increase our sustainability. \nOur Blue products use vacuum switching technology and clean air insulation to produce Zero harmful emissions - and without having to compromise on performance or economic feasibility. With over 10 years of experience in high-voltage vacuum switching, we have been able to maintain outstanding levels of technical performance and low lifecycle costs while reducing our ecological footprint to an enormous extent. Blue is already the perfect choice for substation products. And with the help of our strong partnerships, we can develop and implement it even further and faster. \nIt's impossible to overstate the urgency of cutting carbon emissions. In 2021, global emissions hit an all-time high of 37.1 bn metric tons - and the energy sector has a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined. The elimination of F-gases (and SF6 in particular) from electrical switchgear needs to be achieved as soon as possible. \nOur clean air Blue portfolio already provides a viable alternative, and the shift towards a Zero F-gas future is supported by recent EU legislation to curb the use of these climate- hostile substances. \nNo single company or organization has all the answers, however. The key to tackling the situation is forming partnerships. All industry stakeholders - companies, governments, scientists, even competitors - need to join forces. \nOur new customizable 8VM3 switchgear operates at 72.5 kW and has SensgearTM digital technology built in for greater transparency and enhanced productivity. Its modular design also gives it the flexibility to work in conventional onshore substations as well as offshore wind turbines. \nAt Siemens Energy, we see a partnership as much more than a simple supplier-client relationship. It goes way beyond the placing and delivery of an order. Rather, it's a dose alliance between both parties. We work together towards a shared goal, developing the end solution by exchanging ideas and expertise at every stage. \nThis collaborative, interactive approach is mutually beneficial. Solutions can be shaped to meet particular requirements and the optimal set-up is reached more quickly. \nOur Blue portfolio is already helping our customers around the world to advance towards their carbon reduction goals. Here are just a few examples of the technology - and our close collaborations – in action. \nWe delivered 160 8VM1 Blue Gis bays to this huge project off the coast of the Netherlands, which is capable of supplying up to three million Dutch households with green energy. \n\"Being CO2-neutral is the future and the target for our customers in the offshore wind market, as well as for us at Siemens Energy.\" – Ann-Sofie Bonde Mortensen, Global Vertical Sales Manager Offshore Wind, Siemens Energy. \nThanks to BKK Nett's use of Blue switchgear, the cruise ships in this Norwegian port now use only clean power - with Zero greenhouse gas emissions, Zero F-gases and Zero pollution. \n\"We managed to make the change in Bergen despite having restricted space in our substations. The experience is what we expected: problem-free.\" – Jens Skar, Division Manager, BKK Nett. \nThis high-voltage substation in Burladingen, southern Germany is the first in the world to be eco-efficient, to operate without SF6 and to use digitalization to achieve new levels of connectivity. \n\"The innovation level in this project is very high. The substation of the future is a bold step for us, that requires trust.\" – Marcel Engel, Netze BW expert for grid development. \nWhen we supplied ten bays of our Blue switchgear to Fingrid, we were delivering the first GIS in the country that replaces F-gases with clean air. \n\"With Siemens Energy we have found a reliable partner that offers innovative products with absolutely Zero climate-harming fluorinated gases.\" – Timo Kiiveri, Senior Vice President at Fingrid. \nThe digitally-enabled 145 kV 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers installed at the Hesseln substation incorporate SensgearTM, a cloud- based monitoring solution that provides data to improve grid operation, asset management and maintenance. \n\"The medium-term replacement of the insulating gas SF6 is an essential component of the decarbonization strategy of our E.ON Group.\" – Dr. Markus Obergünner, Senior Vice President High Voltage Grid, Westnetz GmbH. \nGet in contact with our Sales Support and Customer Service \nDo you need help on a concrete project?

These factors can cause stability problems in the HV-grid (reduction of short circuit power/ inertia and voltage dip stability) which might result in a blackout. In order to prevent this, power stations with black start capabilities are required, while synchronous condensers can supply power during short circuits, and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control.  \nA synchronous condenser is a generator without a prime mover from a gas or steam turbine. It stabilizes the grid in changing reactive power demands. The rotating mass and the dynamic generation of reactive power stands for the high advantages of this product. The main benefits of a synchronous condenser are frequency stabilization and power supply during short circuits.  \nAny existing power plant generator type can be converted into a synchronous condenser. It can supply the grid with short circuit power and ensure permanent dynamic voltage and reactive power control. Synchronous condensers are designed to stabilize frequency and maintain voltage even over long distances.  \nThey can generate electricity during dynamic peak demands and are able to build up the grid after a black-out. The project time for converting a plant is usually less than 12 months. The solution allows the use of existing assets and offers a very short return on investment (ROI). \n Minimum costs due to re-use of the existing generator and relevant auxiliary systems. Written-off assets can be reactivated. \n Extended lifetime of a power plant generates additional revenue. \n Decreased risk of blackouts as grid is in an optimum range of operation  \nBlack start capabilities can be built by using an independent power source to restore the plant's auxiliary systems without an external source of supply. \nSuitable technologies are: \n  The process begins with a feasibility study in which the main generator capabilities and grid requirements are assessed.

The high data quality also enables high degree of reliable predictive maintenance, reducing the OPEX of the plant. \nThe solution is designed based on digital enabled efficient work processes and work flows with auto generated engineering of the ICSS and digital software. \nThe ICSS system is based on proven technology assuring the reliability and availability of the production facilities. \nAdvanced and proven work processes support efficient engineering and maintenance of SOGO ICSS & Omnivise for Offshore. \nOur cyber secure solutions are following widely accepted international standards, and the Siemens Energy solution is the first to be TÜV certified. \nIn addition our Topsides 4.0 concept integrate the Siemens Energy rotating equipment portfolio into the SOGO ICSS and Omnivise for Offshore solution. \nSiemens Energy offers a lifecycle management solution for following up the plant during the whole lifecycle. \nOne solution for process, safety, electrical and marine systems acts to optimize the OPEX including maintenance costs. \nThe Oil & Gas industry has been hit by many challenges the last years due to heavy price fluctuations and change in market demand. This has led to changes in the industry. \nThe focus on cost has always been a priority but new technology availability has enabled new ways of reducing operational cost. The introduction of digital tools and functionalities has the power to transform the way the oil gas industry works. \nTypically an ambition is to move from calendar based to condition based maintenance, thus reducing the overall operational cost in the plant. Further operational optimization can be achieved by development of modern remote operated facilities and a focus on reducing time spent on offshore task, which in turn contributes to lower staffing or unmanned facilities. This will also drive the safety aspect but will also challenge the industry related to IT security. \nFurther it is important to deliver an ICSS solutions in compliance with requested standards and regulations. Seamless integration of power generation and distribution systems including efficient and optimized power management into the ICSS system is an important pre requisite in a modern plant. \nOperator systems will be based on accepted standards for human interface providing an easy and intuitive operation of the process plant. \nWe deliver an ICSS systems providing event driven high quality data to the data repository used for digital data processing, with low bandwidth and high resolution. This enables advanced and reliable condition monitoring of all instrumentation and process equipment as well as enabling necessary work process changes in the plant. \nWe believe that a full concept E-A-D (Electrical, Automation, Digitalization) with its seamless integration of data represents the best choice for any future offshore production facility. \nOmnivise for Offshore is a fully scalable digitalization platform from Siemens Energy with the objectives to \nThe solution has four main components: gateway, historian, analytics and dashboard. The gateway can connect to several generations of control systems and third-party systems for collecting data. The historian will hold high resolution event-based plant data for the lifetime of the plant. Analytics will do condition-based monitoring of equipment and alarm/maintenance/production/safety-reporting. The dashboard features live trending, process pictures, dashboards, KPI displays, playback and much more. The solution can be used either as a local only solution or a cloud-based solution. \nAssets are a central part of the Omnivise for Offshore solution. An asset can be a pump, motor, valve and other field equipment, but also switches, routers and IT equipment. Asset templates contains both the condition/performance monitoring to be performed in by analytics framework and the layout of the equipment in the Omnivise for Offshore dashboard. The results of each condition monitored will be output to a time series tag value. There will also be written a health state for each condition, indicating normal, warning or alert. These values can be visualized in customer dashboard as traffic lights or charts. The template is typically created once and then it’s quick to configure multiple instances. In Omnivise for Offshore dashboard each equipment will have its own homepage. \nPredictive Maintenance is an important function to reduce the maintenance effort and to move the maintenance planning to the onshore organization. The main SOGO philosophy is to push data upwards in the hierarchy and store the data in a Historian or Cloud system.  SOGO Analytics runs on top of the Historian and thus has all data sources available (such as ICSS data, vibration data, IoT, engineering data ++). \nAll data collecting from the PCS 7 controllers are event based. This means that data is updated on change and not pulled/polled at an interval from the controllers. At the end of each logic sequence, the controllers will send a snapshot of a selection of values to the gateway if the value is changed outside the dead band configured in the controllers. This has several benefits like high resolution data when it matters: like monitoring of critical temperatures on equipment. Values that are rarely changed don’t have to store duplicate values that have to be cleansed in the historian at a later stage. The network traffic is also kept at a bare minimum since only update values are sent. The PLC is pushing the data, so there is no need for a lot of computing power doing polling of all tags on the gateway.  \nValve example:  \nThe flexible and scalable ICSS solution, its data acquisition and supporting architecture provides the backbone for facilitating NUI operation and maximizing maintenance efficiency.  The ICSS and supporting infrastructure for such facilities is an enhancement of existing designs and practices rather than a fundamental change. \nThe base requirement for NUI operation is facilitation of remote control and operation of the ICSS and supporting infrastructure to be highly integrated. \nThe complete integration will enable the fully redundant ICSS to provide enhanced data acquisition and serve as the main conduit for data transfer to additional support software, such as Condition Based Monitoring and predictive maintenance tools.  Subsea monitoring and/or control can also be facilitated and integrated into the same system. \nSiemens Energy as a leading electrical equipment manufacturer and power solution provider is able to integrate electrical solutions with Omnivise Digital to provide digital benefits to the electrical system. \nFor the Electrical equipment, all measurement values and alarms feed into the ICSS and conditioning monitoring is performed in the IMS. The Engineering Station handles configuration and is used for detailed diagnosis. The electrical system fully conforms to offshore industry standards. \nFigure gives an overview of the interfaces for the main electrical equipment. Via the Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), optimal communication to PCS 7 system is ensured. \nWe deliver a fully integrated solution based on common libraries with data consistency in the full EAD line of plant operations and maintenance. \nThe electrical system is designed for easy expansion and flexibility. It is built on a network structure with a high degree of integration of all systems for operation and maintenance, and is designed to support remote operation from onshore. All main electrical equipment is enabled for condition-based monitoring, making it easier to carry out necessary maintenance without extensive manpower. \nIn addition to greenfield solutions, Siemens Energy implements solutions on existing facilities. \nSuch solutions enable efficient decision making and proactive operational management on existing facilities, via access to timely data, data visualization, monitoring/alerting capabilities and access to relevant systems and supporting documentation. \nFor brownfield solutions, please get in touch to discuss your needs. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"ICSS\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product/icss.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Products\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product-offerings.html\" has the following content:\nWe support companies and countries to reduce emissions across the energy landscape – for a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy system \nProviding power and heat in a reliable, affordable and sustainable way in a world of rising energy demand requires a complex journey - and technologies that can be combined to shape a new energy landscape.

Currently, there are thousands of centrifugal compressors installed globally that predate advanced Dry Gas Seal (DGS) technology and run with wet oil seals, which require costly maintenance and cause parasitic power losses due to oil shear and drag.  \nThe Dry Gas Seals employed in our centrifugal compressors represent a significant advance in shaft sealing. This state-of-the-art solution will help by eliminating the ongoing maintenance costs associated with wet oil seals and thereby greatly increases equipment reliability and efficiency. The design of the Dry Gas Seal ensures best overall compressor performance as well as emission reduction for increased sustainability.   \nThe heart of the DGS is a pair of rings. A stationary ring is held against a rotating ring by spring pressure. The contact face of the rotating ring incorporates special fil-riding geometries in the form of groves or tapered lands on the outer portion. \nDGS designs: \nSiemens Energy, as the compressor OEM, is best suited to provide a sealing solution that ensures the best overall compressor performance and maintenance, from a single source. Applicable to all OEM and non-OEM centrifugal compressors. \nDry gas seal retrofits, recompression help legacy compressors comply with current, future regulations. \nOur innovative sealing solution eliminates the need for a seal gas booster, protects dry gas seals from contamination, reduces maintenance and downtime costs.\nSeal Protect sits between the dry gas seal and process side seal, remaining open during operation to prevent contamination. In static or low-speed conditions, it ensures only clean, dry process gas reaches the Dry Gas Seal.\n \nBenefits of Seal Protect include:\nIncreased reliability: Our simplified design reduces component failure risk.Reduced cost: With lower operational and maintenance costs.Minimized footprint: Our system can replace the seal gas booster, saving space.Lower emissions: Seal Protect uses less power, reducing emissions.\nSeal Protect is compatible with most new compressor packages and can be retrofitted into existing units for improved reliability. \n \n \n \nOur innovative sealing solution eliminates the need for a seal gas booster, protects dry gas seals from contamination, reduces maintenance and downtime costs. \nSeal Protect sits between the dry gas seal and process side seal, remaining open during operation to prevent contamination.

The interests of operators and investors, on the one hand, and those of utilities and grids, on the other, are becoming more closely aligned. This is because ensuring a stable power supply as well as the financial success of the power plant are common goals.  \nThe biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built. It will apply novel process innovations to sustainably convert 100 percent wood into bio-based mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), mono-propylene glycol (MPG) as well as renewable functional fillers (RFF).  \nWith more widespread environmental awareness and the resultant striving for “green” lifestyles, biomass energy for both industry and electricity providers is a reliable – and sustainable – source of baseload power. \nIt also helps in meeting environmental targets, absorbing more CO₂ than it emits, and efficient equipment used in power generation leads to fewer emissions at the plant site. \nBiomass is a relatively cheap base load and, depending on the local regulations, surplus electricity produced from it can be fed back to the grid, making it even more economically viable. \nInstalling a biomass power plant to burn the on-site waste that occurs as a by-product of industrial processes closes the factory input cycle. \nIt also eliminates the need for waste disposal, lowers energy costs and maintains a high availability of the power supply. \nIncinerating renewables is thus a further step toward sustainability and toward a closed-cycle economy. These by-products need no additional processing, further strengthening the financial feasibility of the biomass plant. \nThe possibility of running a biomass plant on diverse feedstocks adds to the viability of such projects while ensuring the availability of the fuel supply. \nApart from achieving maximum output with a minimum of life-cycle costs, another decisive economic factor is the need for appropriate frameworks already in the country concerned, regulating such variables as electricity prices, the level of tipping tax, and funding. \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint.\n \nWith their leading efficiency profile and minimal outages, our turbines maximize the amount of electricity generated while further reducing a plant’s lifetime emissions footprint. \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service.\n \nAll our turbines offer a long life cycle thanks to reliable equipment that is backed by our global service. \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population.\n \nThanks to our long list of references we can help gain acceptance for biomass energy among the authorities and the local population. \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications.\n \nWe can support you from the very beginning with our technical consulting and expertise, dealing with all the parties involved and avoiding any complications. \nCapturing the potential of Vietnam biomass energy growth with tailor made high-efficiency steam turbines \nIndustries producing a large amount of process (biomass) waste can convert it into carbon-neutral energy to power their facilities or sell into the grid for additional revenue. \nReheat solutions significantly increase the overall efficiency of a biomass plant and are therefore an optimal solution to produce more energy without having to use more fuel. \nCo-generation with high-tech steam turbines and generators in sugar production. \nDownload the white paper \nPartnering with an experienced equipment manufacturer is an important step toward commissioning a new biomass plant. \nSiemens Energy Customer Support  \n+49 911 6505 6505 (Charges depending on provider) \n+49 180 524 25 71 (Charges depending on provider; from the German fixed network € 0.14/min. and from the German mobile phone networks max. € 0.42/min.) \nSupervisory Board extends contract with CEO Christian Bruch  \nEarnings Release Q3 FY 2024: Siemens Energy on track to meet full-year guidance including an improved cash outlook \nSiemens Energy wins contract for large-scale hydrogen project from German utility EWE \n1.5 billion US-Dollar order for Siemens Energy in Saudi Arabia: Efficient combined cycle power plants for the country's energy supply \n\n\t\t\t\t\tStay in Touch\n\t\t\t\t \nSiemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG. © Siemens Energy, 2024 \nThe page with name \"Biomass\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/solutions-usecase/biomass-to-power.html\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Hydrogen Power Plants\" and URL \"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/hydrogen-power-plants.html\" has the following content:\nHydrogen plants for both, existing and new units \nSiemens Energy is combining its unique portfolio of gas and steam turbines, electrolyzers, and heat pumps, and turning it into a unique optimized power plant solution with one operating system. \nIntegration of hydrogen into gas turbine power plant. \nProducts of hydrogen gas turbines \nIncreased efficiency in hydrogen production \nElectricity production with lower emissions \nIntegration of renewable energy into reliable power and heat supply \nFuture proof power plant \nDecarbonization through hydrogen for electricity generation \nWould you like to learn more?  \nCalculate your carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and cost-savings potential by running your aeroderivative, industrial, and heavy-duty gas turbines fully or partially with hydrogen. \nWhat are the steps required for introducing hydrogen as a fuel in a natural gas power plant? \nWatch the video to learn how to get your plant ready for hydrogen co-firing.  \nOur hydrogen power plants include use cases for newly build as well as existing installations.

Although these components have high reliability, failures can occur due to external factors such as short circuits in the grid. Failures can also occur due to the aging effects of the active part, especially the insulation system, or the aging of important accessories such as bushings or on-load tap changers. In case of failure, the first action is to identify the type of failure. The aim is to localize the failure and its root cause.​\n​\nRepairing a transformer instead of replacing it can substantially reduce investment costs and provide a faster turnaround than buying a new transformer. Furthermore, to maximize the asset's technical life, a refurbishment or overhaul can be an intermediate action when no failure has occurred, and the aging of the active part has reached a stage where the continued reliability of the transformer is unacceptable.​ \nUpgrade, repair, and extend services are frequently used options that can be performed either in an authorized service workshop or at the customer site. The reconditioned equipment undergoes complete testing and comes with a warranty. \n​ \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Upgrade, Repair, & Extend | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/upgrade-repair-and-extend\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Technical product guide | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformer/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection?filterable-30654145-taxonomy_offering_products-services_product-specifications_bushings_technology=taxonomy%3Aoffering%2Fproducts-services%2Fproduct-specifications%2Fbushings%2Ftechnology%2Fnon-condenser-core\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for?

The method is also gaining acceptance for re-energizing of EHV transmission lines, replacing traditional pre-insertion resistors. Since 1986, thousands of Switchsync controllers have been delivered all over the world. \nSwitchsync PWC600 is Hitachi Energy's latest generation of point-on-wave controllers. Offering the full functionality and reliability of previous Switchsync products, it additionally includes Ethernet interfaces, which support modern communication protocols, and enhanced functionality and flexibility towards the user. \nSwitchsync PWC600 is designed for single-pole operated circuit breakers, controlling each pole to close and/or open at the optimal point on the wave for the switched load, the circuit breaker, and power quality. It features unprecedented flexibility for switching various loads with diverse configurations, comprehensive monitoring functionality to track circuit breaker behavior, and handling multiple loads connected to the same breaker. For power transformers, PWC600 can estimate the residual fluxes in the core to minimize energization transients under all switching scenarios. For transmission lines, PWC600 can detect secondary arcs and predict the non-periodic gap voltage across the circuit breaker after a protection trip, to minimize switching overvoltages and prevent missing current zeros during auto-reclosing. It compensates for variations in environmental factors and drifts in circuit breaker properties. An intuitive configuration tool and local and web-based user interfaces facilitate easy access to the relevant functions. The product offers waveforms and operations recording facility with time & date stamping to assist in interpreting the controlled switching performance. \nHitachi Energy's high-voltage circuit breakers are well suited for controlled switching, featuring consistent operating times and steep and stable dynamic dielectric withstand capability.\n  \nOur sales team will get in touch with you  \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Switchsync® PWC600 | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/switchsync\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"DC bushings type GSD | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection/dc-bushings-type-gsd\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nHitachi Energy is a world-leading supplier of components for HVDC applications.

Hitachi Energy offers a complete pure cooling system portfolio for industrial and power transmission applications with cooling capacity from 2 kW to several megawatts. \nHitachi Energy's pure water cooling systems are reliable and energy-efficient solutions with optimized life cycle costs. The cooling media in our solutions is water. The specific application determines when to use tap water, glycol water, or pure water. \nOur cooling system solutions are available for every stage of the product life cycle from development, design, sales and production, to assembly, testing, installation, commissioning, training and service. \nOur cooling media is water. The quality of water needed is determined by the specific application:  \nPure water - when water with low conductivity is needed \nPower electronic applications such as: \nTap water - when conductivity is no issue \nApplications include \nGlycol/water mixture - when there is a risk for freezing \nThe principle of all pure-water cooling systems is fundamentally the same. There is a main loop cooling the object. Water transfers the heat to water-to-water or water-to-air heat exchangers. From the main loop a small part of the flow passes a water-processing circuit. The water is filtered mechanically. If necessary, it is also continuously purified from ions and oxygen. The conductivity of the cooling water can be maintained as low as <0.1µS/cm (at 25°C). \nOur cooling systems are prefabricated and assembled in one or several units. Most of the systems include control equipment with PLC and software. The systems are tested and verified before delivery. \nAs we deliver systems globally, we have developed design standards and control routines for efficient onsite installation and start up. Most of our customers can easily set up the systems themselves by following our manuals.  \nAs an option the systems can be delivered as a ready-to use container solution. This can be used to optimize logistics, minimize outage time and installation time.  \nIn a regular container solution the cooling system pump unit, treatment circuit, motor starters as well as the protection and system control are mounted into an enclosure or container. Optional equipment for the container may include insulation, ventilation, lighting, heating and air conditioning. \n \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Cooling system products and services | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/cooling-systems\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Technical product guide | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformer/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection?filterable-30654145-taxonomy_offering_products-services_product-specifications_bushings_technology=taxonomy%3Aoffering%2Fproducts-services%2Fproduct-specifications%2Fbushings%2Ftechnology%2Fresin-impregnated-paper-rip\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for?

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers. Our bushings are suitable for outdoor and indoor applications and are available in several designs that enable a high customization freedom to fit almost all transformer requirements. \nHitachi Energy non-condenser core bushings for power transformers where the design is in conformance with IEC 60137: \nIn addition, Hitachi Energy offers non-condenser core bushings for distribution transformers that are designed in conformance with regional standards (DIN, EN, BS):\n \nTXpert™ Bushing monitoring solution provides real time bushing monitoring for power transformers according to the two main technologies: voltage reference and sum of current.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store.

Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way. \nThe TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.\n \nThyristor controlled series compensation principle\nThere are two main principles supporting TCSC technology. \nThe TCSC achieves both objectives by using control algorithms that work concurrently. The controls will function on the thyristor circuit (this in parallel to the main capacitor bank) such that controlled charges are added to the main capacitor, making it a variable capacitor at fundamental frequency but a \"virtual inductor\" at subsynchronous frequencies. \nThyristor controlled series compensation technology\nFrom a principal technology point of view, the TCSC resembles the conventional series capacitor. The power equipment is located on an isolated steel platform, including the thyristor valve used to control the inductor in parallel with the capacitor bank. The inductor is placed on support insulators outside the platform. Control and protection systems are located on ground potential, together with other auxiliary systems. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Thyristor controlled series compensation | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/facts/thyristor-controlled-series-compensation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Hitachi Energy bushings for AC transformers and reactors | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-for-ac-applications\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nOur bushings are an essential component of AC transformers and reactors, helping to ensure that these critical pieces of equipment operate safely and reliably over the long term. \nHitachi Energy bushings are electrical insulation components that are designed for AC transformers and reactors. They typically provide a high-voltage connection between the transformer or reactor and an external circuit while also ensuring that the high-voltage is safely insulated from the surrounding environment. \nHitachi Energy bushings are made to specifically fulfill the needs of AC reactors and transformers, which run at high voltages and currents. They are typically constructed from premium materials that can handle severe electrical and mechanical stresses, such as porcelain or composite materials. \nThe bushings come in various forms, including oil-filled and dry-type bushings, and are compatible with a wide range of transformers and reactors.

Moreover,\n \nModular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) control provides advanced fault registration and remote control functions. The system is designed to run 24/7 for thirty years or more, allowing the HVDC system to be controlled and protected in the most reliable way throughout its life time. \nTo fulfill current and future requirements Hitachi Energy has developed the Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) system as a fully computerized one, using state-of-the-art computers, microcontrollers and digital signal processors connected by high-performance industrial standard buses and fiber optic communication links. Because of the extensive use of computers and micro-controllers, it has been possible to include very powerful internal supervision, which eliminates periodic maintenance of the control equipment. \nThe system consists of the station control and monitoring servers, operator workstations, control and protection main computers, digital signal processor units, I/O systems and valve control units. Thanks to the modularity and high performance of the MACH equipment, the type of hardware and system software used for a VSC-HVDC  control system are the same as in an LCC-HVDC or a FACTS control system. In fact, only the application software and the valve control differs. \nThe ability to upgrade is yet another advantage with Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™). That means even an older HVDC system can enjoy the benefits of great controllability. This is a great way to prolong the lifetime of an existing transmission link with rapid project completion and minimal transmission disruption. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"MACH™ control and protection system | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/hvdc/mach-control-and-protection-system\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Inspection and diagnostics | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/inspection-and-diagnostics\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nThe three main factors which can affect the health of the transformers are paper, which is used for conductor insulation; the pressboard, which is used for the major insulation and winding support; and the insulating oil. \nWith age, water and contaminants (air or gas bubbles, particles of different origins, oxygen, and oil aging) dissolve in the dielectric fluid of the transformer, increasing the risk of failures or accelerating aging of the insulation system, thus reducing the technical life. The level of possible contamination of the insulating oil over the years depends on its design, especially on the effectiveness of the oil preservation system and sources of contamination.\n \nBy sampling and analyzing the dielectric fluid, contaminants can be detected, and appropriate preventative actions initiated. The Oil and Gas Analysis remains a critical component of the condition assessment of the transformer. \nUsing our global reach, we support many customers worldwide in the collection of oil samples, the oil and gas analysis in our certified oil laboratories, as well as providing a first analysis of the unit's health status. Combining this with our extensive design knowledge as well as repair/refurbishment know-how accumulated over the years, we can present a more comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations to prolong the usage of the transformer. \nOnline oil regeneration has technical and economic advantages when applied to old transformers with aged, acidic oil. The process is more environmentally friendly than oil replacement and demonstrates much better efficiency over the long term. This is a very efficient alternative to passivation since it enables the definitive removal of corrosive compounds from corrosive oils, thus avoiding the risk of copper sulfide formation. \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Inspection and diagnostics | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/inspection-and-diagnostics\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Traction transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/transformers/special-application-transformers/traction-transformers\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nTraction transformers are critical components in the traction chain, affecting train performance and operator services.

Online monitoring is an effective tool to increase performance, reduce failure risks, and cut maintenance costs. Compared to traditional diagnostic methods performed on-site with the transformer de-energized, monitoring gives you, the asset owner, access to real-time condition information, even from remote locations. When changes in conditions are detected, you are notified immediately. \nThrough remote access, the status of the equipment can be evaluated without dispatching an engineer to the site, saving both valuable time and resources. Since monitoring detects condition changes in real-time - versus periodically with traditional diagnostic methods - you have time to plan and act before faults occur. \nWith the help of our TXpert™ Services, you, as an asset owner, can decide the level of digitalization for your transformer, which will help you determine the right course of action by having complete visibility and control over the performance of your asset or fleet. \nThese services can also be designed as packaged solutions or long-term agreements. \nSubmit your inquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"TXpert™ Services | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/the-txpert-ecosystem/txpert-services\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Transformer Insulation and Components | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \n📢 Missed the live session?

Since the late 90s, Hitachi Energy has offered a modular three-step approach to a Condition-Based Maintenance or Reliability Centered Maintenance program:\n \nStep 1. Fleet screening survey: A quick scan of a large population (20 to 200 units) collects easily accessible data, such as unit nameplate data, oil and dissolved-gas-in-oil data, load profile, history of the unit, and sister units.\n \nStep 2. Condition assessment: At this stage, transformer design experts focus on a smaller number of units (10 to 20) identified in step 1. They use modern design rules and tools to evaluate the original design. Advanced diagnostic tests are performed to assess each of the principal properties of the transformer in a structured way. This assessment leads to an estimate of each transformer`s risk of failure and defines action plans to improve the reliability of each unit. \nStep 3. Expertise: The number of units to be further analyzed is typically limited to two or three out of a population of 100 units. This third module of the assessment process provides accurate information with respect to overloading transformers, enhancing their performance (power or voltage increase), or extending their lifetime. \nOur service offerings assess the operational condition of transformers, provide recommendations to mitigate risks, and enhance the performance of aged equipment to meet possible new requirements. It also provides state-of-the-art information on online monitoring solutions, maintenance, and repair options to be used to ensure reliable operating conditions. \nIt is three steps approach that can be applied to a single or fleet of transformers. The steps include fleet screening, design and condition assessment, and life assessment /profiling of the transformer fleet. The reports provide each transformer's condition and life assessment with recommendations for further action in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of failures. \nFor more information on MTMP™, please download the leaflet below: \nVisual Inspection, Standard Oil Test (SOT), Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Furan Analysis, Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), Copper Sulphide (Cu2S), Standard and Special Tests \nAdvanced Dissolved Gas Analysis (ADGA), Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), On-Load Tap Changer Vibration Diagnostic, Dielectric Frequency Response (DFR), Partial Discharge Analysis (PDA) \nFor more information on Advance Diagnostics Testing, please download the leaflet below: \nHigh-voltage testing, including applied and induced testing with Partial Discharge measurement on-site. \nFor more information on TrafoSiteTesting™, please see the links below: \nOur bushing diagnostics package includes required inspection and testing to determine the condition of your bushings accurately, providing early warning of failure and enabling proactive replacement planning.

Reduce costs and increase system reliability using Hitachi Energy's digital substation technology, either for new or retrofit installations of air- and gas-insulated switchgear substations. ​Once digitalized, enterprise-level asset performance management systems enable your utility to plan substation maintenance like never before and bring new levels of efficiency and sustainability to your operations. \n\nUp to 80%\n            Up to 80%\n         \nDigital substations replace costly point-to-point copper signaling wires with a few fiber optic communication buses. That means you reduce your substation’s footprint: Less space is required for microprocessor-based protection and control panels. \n\nUp to 60%\n            Up to 60%\n         \nIncrease reliability, safety, and satisfaction while growing your ROI. Discover which solutions from our digital substation portfolio work best for your needs.   \n\n15000+\n15000+\n         \n\n50+\n50+\n         \n\n40+\n40+\n         \nThe digital substation components allow interfacing with all old and new technologies. To interface with existing equipment, we offer standalone merging units and breaker intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) (SAM600 I/O system). \nIn general, digital technology will reduce testing in the future, as all systems will become supervised and will allow you to shift from fixed, time-based to condition- or risk-based maintenance schemes. Specifically testing the digital substation provides a safer testing behavior that reduces the effort for disconnection voltage and current circuits. \nThe digital substation has different entry points, making it easy for you to get started with the application and amount of technology that best fit your organization’s current needs and level of maturity. For example, you can begin with monitoring or communications to test how it benefits you in the short term. Once you’ve undertaken this step, the next step could be to translate this learning to the network or enterprise level. In short, you do not necessarily have to begin with an entire digital substation and instead can start with a test concept. Hitachi Energy has a long history of successfully delivering digital substation projects, having worked on more than 50 digital substations, and we are perfectly positioned to guide you through the project based on your pace and specific organizational needs. \nDigital technology improves safety because there are fewer signal connections or inadvertently opened CT circuits that could harm personnel during commissioning and service activities.  \nDigital substations reduce your carbon footprint because they require less space for protection and control panels. Also, functions that were previously executed by physically separate equipment can be integrated into one device.\n\n \nAchieve higher productivity with new asset management systems that include monitoring and diagnostics data from substation equipment. This added insight substantially improves the efficiency of service activities. Monitoring and diagnostics are strategic features for utilities, further reducing outage time and increasing reliability.\n\n \nTake the lead in the digitalization of your grid, ensure longer lifecycle of your assets, and ensure a more secure communication environment with IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 Hitachi Energy certified products and tools.  Hitachi Energy’s SAM600 and PCM600 are designed and certified to comply to the latest IEC61850 Ed. 2.1 standard, enabling interoperability and reliable communication between digital assets even in complex systems. \nSince its publication in 2004, the global IEC 61850 standard has been accepted at a remarkably fast rate. Developed with the support of Hitachi Energy, it is the first truly global standard in the electric utility field.\n\nThe evolution hasn't stopped there. Since the advent of the IEC 61850 edition 2 in 2011, which takes the standard outside of the substation, Hitachi Energy invested tremendous efforts in implementing this standard in our systems, tools, and products. We believe IEC 61850 is the basis for a successful and modern digital grid. \nThe defining feature of a digital substation is the implementation of a process bus. The introduction of IEC 61850 in 2005 was a key enabler for digitization and digitalization of power systems everywhere. The various technological advances spurred by IEC 61850 raised customer expectations about the quality and reliability of power supply. The IEC 61850 process bus enables the substitution of point-to-point copper connections between IEDs and other devices (e.g., instruments transformers, gas monitoring, etc.) with a safe and standardized optical communication bus.  \nHitachi Energy has a longstanding experience in digital substations, placing it at the market forefront of this technology innovation, ensuring compliance with the highest standards in the industry.\n \nRetrofitting is a vital and natural next step to extend the service life of your substation, helping to lower capital expenditure and increase network reliability. \nRetrofit scenarios are pivotal for substations, as the lifecycle of secondary equipment is typically half that of primary devices. \nHowever, retrofit projects are, by their nature, more challenging than new projects. This is because of compatibility challenges between the old and new devices, which, in turn, could cause operational disruptions during commissioning. \nThere are many directions you can take to install or upgrade a substation, depending on needs and budget. Therefore, it is important to choose a strategic partner who is an expert in the field to ensure the smooth installation and functioning of your new or retrofitted substations. \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Digital Substations | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substation-automation-protection-and-control/substation-automation-systems/digital-substation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"AC bushings type RJ and LCRJ | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components/transformer-bushings/bushings-product-selection/ac-bushings-type-rj-and-lcrj\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for?

This can be done with minimum changes to existing equipment while ensuring performance of the equipment and significantly lowering environmental impact.\n \nIn this process, SF6 from the installed gas-insulated lines is evacuated and filled into gas bottles for recycling or disposal and the GIL is then flushed to remove any humidity. The new eco-efficient gas mixture is then filled into the GIL and the switchgear is re-energized to connect back to the grid. The process is relatively quick and enables the reuse of passive gas components designed for SF6 to be converted into non-SF6 equipment, thereby improving their environmental and lifecycle performance. \nEconiQ is Hitachi Energy's eco-efficient portfolio for sustainability where products, services and solutions are proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance. \nApplications \nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n \nBenefits of EconiQ retrofill solution:\n  \nEconiQ retrofill for gas-insulated lines ELK-3, 420 kV \nCO2 equivalent relative reduction to SF6 \n 98.8% \nRatings \nRated nominal voltage Um \n420 kV (440 kV 60min) \nPower frequency withstand voltage \n650 kV (r.m.s. value) \nRated switching / lightning impulse withstand voltage \n1,050 kV / 1,425 kV (peak value) \nRated current at 40 °C (50 Hz, 60 Hz) \n4,000 A \n5,000 A \nRated short time withstand current/duration \n63 kA / 3 s \nRated peak-withstand current (peak value) \n171 kA \nTemperature range \nProduct leaflet \nPress release \nSuccess case \nBlog \nOur sales team will get in touch with you  \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"EconiQ retrofill for gas-insulated lines ELK-3, 420 kV | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/econiq-eco-efficient-hv-portfolio/econiq-retrofill-gil-elk-3-420kv\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Low-voltage capacitors and filters | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/capacitors-and-filters/low-voltage-capacitors-and-filters\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nWith energy transition, good power quality is becoming more and more essential for utility, industrial and commercial networks.

Manufactured in Italy, the groundbreaking equipment made at Hitachi Energy’s factory in Lodi is set to be installed in 2025. The move marks a significant step forward towards a sustainable electricity network in Italy. \nInnovative EconiQ technology accelerates China's power grid decarbonization. \nInnovative switchgear enables phaseout of SF6, a greenhouse gas 24,300 times more potent than CO2, staying in the atmosphere for over 1,000 years. \nTenneT’s Maasbracht substation has the longest SF6-free gas-insulated line installation in Europe. \nHitachi Energy has booked orders for over 65 units of its groundbreaking EconiQ 420-kilovolt Dead Tank Breaker and the world is taking note. \nHitachi Energy and Linxon are collaborating to strengthen London Power Tunnels, a key power infrastructure project that will ensure reliable, clean electricity supply for England’s capital city. \nOn June 20, the breakthrough EconiQ dead tank breaker was delivered to Eversource during an exclusive event at Hitachi Energy’s state-of-the-art factory in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, USA. \nThe agreement affirms the need to reduce F-gas emissions and ensures at the same time that high-voltage substations will remain safe, reliable, and compact. \nShifting the global electricity supply toward carbon-free sources is essential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a priority in combatting climate change. The world added 295 gigawatts (GW) of renewable \nBreakthrough technology unlocks the widest range in eco-efficient switchgear applications and accelerates the energy transition \nFingrid takes yet another step to phase out sulfur hexaflouride (SF₆) from its high-voltage equipment. EconiQ Live Tank Breaker – LTA for 145-kilovolt (kV) to be installed at Heinola substation in Finland will help to do just that. \nThe innovation called EconiQ™ retrofill uses eco-efficient gas mixture to support National Grid in achieving their sustainability targets. \nSP Energy Networks is contributing to achieve the decarbonization goals by avoiding the addition of over 3,000 kilograms of sulfur hexafluoride to the transmission electricity network. \nHitachi Energy has signed a frame agreement with Norway’s major distribution grid company, BKK Nett to install EconiQ™ Live Tank Breakers (LTA) 145 kV in more than 10 substations in the western region.

\nStandard transformers are extremely rigid and strong structures, but when extreme pressure builds up due to internal failures, transformers can very rarely rupture, creating safety and environmental hazards. \nLike crumple zones in modern cars, which protect passengers by absorbing the energy during a crash for controlled damage, increased flexibility can provide the solution.\n \nTXpand™ is a new power transformer technology for rupture resistance, enhancing safety for people and the environment. Transformers containing this technology can literally expand, absorbing energy from faults.\n \nHitachi Energy has developed the TXpand™ technology through careful analysis and modeling to make the most rigid areas flexible, the weakest points stronger, and integrating rupture points to take control of the most unpredictable failures. \nThe TXpand™ solution has been demonstrated as capable of absorbing the expansion caused by a simulated 20 megajoule fault. Containing the energy safely, reducing risk and increasing safety for people in and around power substations. \nThe features of TXpand™ design mitigate the consequences of even catastrophic failures. \nIn tests simulating a very large and impossible contain, 66 megajoule fault the TXpand™ demonstrated that the rupture can be controlled; minimizing any oil spilled and predictably channeling what little oil escapes for more easy containment. \nMore control and easier containment not only protect people in the area but also protect other valuable assets in a substation. \nBy preventing damage to other substation equipment, the risk of power failure is reduced, and maintenance or replacement of this equipment is minimized. \nOur sales team will get in touch with you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"TXpand™ | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/power-transformers/txpand\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)  | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/modular-switchgear-monitoring-msm\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nModular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) is used to supervise, manage and analyze performance of all type of high-voltage switchgear in new installations as well as a retrofit solution in existing high-voltage assets. The system operates independently of existing control and protection devices and can be installed in new substations or retrofitted in existing installations. By continuously monitoring critical parameters, MSM provides the base layer for a predictive maintenance strategy for the installation.The system is compliant with IEC 61850 and DNP 3.0 and it is provided with a web interface where all monitored data are accessible. \nApplications\n \nBased on the monitoring application, MSM is offered in 2 versions with additional options: \nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n   \nSF6 moisture \nHighly stable SF6 and gas density sensors are used to continuously monitor the integrity of the gas compartments and identify gas losses at an early stage. Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications: \nMSM gas monitoring feature is compatible with EconiQTM portfolio and other gas mixtures. \nNon-invasive hall sensors and signals from auxiliary switches are used to monitor key parameters of the circuit breaker. Measured signals include phase current during operation, trip and close coil current, and motor current. Monitored parameters are categorized in mechanical performance, wear, as well as accessories. Measured curves are stored as comtrade files on the system, allowing further analysis. \n\nAll features of MSM-I are included in this application as well.\n\nBenefits of MSM-II for circuit-breaker applications:\n \nHumidity Monitoring \nHigh levels of humidity in SF6 impact its dielectric withstand (the condensation of water on the surface of insulators will lead to significant reduction of dielectric strength and flashover) and on the formation of corrosive and toxic decomposition products. It is important to control humidity during initial manufacture, assemble, commissioning and over the lifetime of the equipment. \nContinuous humidity monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. \nCorrect heater operation in drives, cubicles, etc. is crucial for reliable operation of circuit breakers. \nMonitoring of heaters is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II\n \n\nDisconnector and earthing switch monitoring\n \nDisconnector and earthing switches are critical live components of high-voltage switchgears. Disconnector monitoring is provided as an option, applicable to MSM-II \n\nInternal arc localization\n \nDetect an internal fault arc and localize the gas compartment where it occurs is important since the event has a possible impact on gas dielectric withstand. \nMSM allows to reduce the effort to determine the fault location by gas pressure analysis, automatically identifying the gas compartment where an arc occurs.  \nInternal arc localization is provided as an option, applicable to both MSM-I and MSM-II. \n\nTravel curve monitoring with measured travel curve\n \nMechanical performance of switchgear depends on the travel characteristic of the closing and open operations. \nMSM-II can simulate travel curve but if accurate travel curve measure is needed, the travel curve monitoring with measured travel curve option can be installed. \nMSM provides:\n\n \nOur sales team will get in touch with you  \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)  | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/monitoring-and-controlled-switching/modular-switchgear-monitoring-msm\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"EconiQ™ Live Tank Circuit Breaker – LTA | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/high-voltage-switchgear-and-breakers/air-insulated-switchgear/econiq-live-tank-breaker-lta\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \n\nThe EconiQ LTA breaker uses the same technology as the well-proven Hitachi Energy's SF6 Live Tank Circuit Breaker product range.

In our flagship RIS line EasyDry®, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.\n \nHitachi Energy’s paperless RIS bushings are made of a synthetic non-woven material that is wound around a conductor with aluminum foil inserts for electrical stress control. The core is afterward vacuum-impregnated with epoxy resin and cured, giving a partial discharge-free dry bushing. \nThis paperless bushing technology has an advanced insulation performance due to its non-hygroscopic insulation that is not sensitive to moisture ingress and absorption. In addition, RIS bushings will have a superior effect on the power factor (dielectric losses), and the intrinsic aging behavior leading to an extended product lifetime. \nJoin us for the live and interactive webinar we hosted on June 15, 2023.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store.

The quality of water needed is determined by the specific application:  \nPure water - when water with low conductivity is needed \nPower electronic applications such as: \nTap water - when conductivity is no issue \nApplications include \nGlycol/water mixture - when there is a risk for freezing \nThe principle of all pure-water cooling systems is fundamentally the same. There is a main loop cooling the object. Water transfers the heat to water-to-water or water-to-air heat exchangers. From the main loop a small part of the flow passes a water-processing circuit. The water is filtered mechanically. If necessary, it is also continuously purified from ions and oxygen. The conductivity of the cooling water can be maintained as low as <0.1µS/cm (at 25°C). \nOur cooling systems are prefabricated and assembled in one or several units. Most of the systems include control equipment with PLC and software. The systems are tested and verified before delivery. \nAs we deliver systems globally, we have developed design standards and control routines for efficient onsite installation and start up. Most of our customers can easily set up the systems themselves by following our manuals.  \nAs an option the systems can be delivered as a ready-to use container solution. This can be used to optimize logistics, minimize outage time and installation time.  \nIn a regular container solution the cooling system pump unit, treatment circuit, motor starters as well as the protection and system control are mounted into an enclosure or container. Optional equipment for the container may include insulation, ventilation, lighting, heating and air conditioning. \n \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Cooling system products and services | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/cooling-systems\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"PQpluS™ modular units for Battery Energy Storage Systems | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/energystorage/pqplus\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nAvailable in two frame sizes, depending on the energy rating needed. \nKey characteristics: \nIntegrators and end users working on: \nPQpluS can also be integrated by:\n  \nApplications \nWhen aggregated into a larger system: \nHitachi Energy  BESS is installed in an urban environment to supply power to approximately 200 apartments in Copenhagen at the time of the day when the power demand is at its peak. \nSamso Island and seasonal vacation demand to power island marina.

It is highly efficient for transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances, integration of renewables and interconnecting grids, opening up for new sustainable transmission solutions. \nHVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations. \nHVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used. \nHitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world. \nThe control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability. \nIdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time. \nAn HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks. \nCables and small converter stations - HVDC has great potential for city applications. \nHVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day. \nAvoid using expensive fuel in small uneconomic plants - make an HVDC connection to a larger grid. \nDC technology provides a more secure and optimized control of a network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout. \nBeing proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown. \nIn many regions of the world, liberalized energy markets have introduced the phenomenon of trading to electricity sectors and trading is enabled by coupling electricity markets with network interconnections. \nHitachi Energy's technology for the offshore wind power industry is essential in the transmission of high quality power with minimal loss. \nMany classical HVDC systems use overhead transmission lines. In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations. \nHVDC Light® can be used to deliver power both to and from offshore platforms. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/hvdc\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Reactors and inductors | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/transformers/reactors-and-inductors\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for?

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

Increasing amounts of transmitted energy push the networks to the limit, increasing the risk of network instability. \nPSTs allow controlling the power flow in the transmission grid independently of the generation. Avoiding system overloads and instabilities protects transmission lines and HV equipment from thermal overload, improves transmission system stability, and controls the power flow between different networks for parallel long-distance overhead lines or for parallel cables. \nPSTs are highly specialized pieces of equipment that require leading-edge design and manufacturing skills combined with stringent quality control. They are highly complex power transformers, with more windings and tap changers than traditional power transformers and a large number of connections between the three phases. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Phase-shifting transformers (PST) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/power-transformers/system-intertie-transformers/phase-shifting-transformers\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Safeguarding surrounding ecosystems | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/econiq-transformers/safeguarding-surrounding-ecosystems\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nEliminating mineral oil leakages and enhancing safety is vital. \nOur experience with biodegradable insulation fluids is unrivaled, with over 200 power transformers installed in 21 countries around the world, totaling in excess of 10,500 MVA delivered and 950 years in service.

But they are often located in densely populated areas or close to sensitive ecosystems. Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards. \nApart from being oil-free, all components of dry-type transformers are in solid form; they do not have flash points or require bushings. Thus, major causes of fire and oil spillage are eliminated. The majority of insulating components used dry-type transformers can also be easily recycled. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for dry-type transformers is much lower due to the lower cost of installation and the need for a fire suppression system.\n \nHitachi Energy has been leading the development, manufacturing, and supply of dry-type transformers for more than 40 years - with path-leading technological innovation. Hitachi Energy offers a full range of dry-type transformers with primary voltages through 72.5 kV built according to all major standards, including IEC and ANSI. \n \nWith recent technological advances, Hitachi Energy has successfully designed and installed a dry-type transformer that can withstand 100 kV / 550kV Basic Impulse Level (BIL). Thus paving the way for using this sustainable and environment-friendly transformer technology at even sub-transmission level.\n \nThese transformers meet strict parameters with respect to electrical system demands and functioning in areas with extreme climatic conditions.

more\n\n \nWith EconiQ™ Implementation services, Hitachi Energy has created a tailored program that helps our customers analyze the environmental impact of power grid maintenance and project activities, defining concrete actions to reduce it, and compensate for the remaining emissions.\n\n The activities we execute during our power systems lifecycle are essential to secure their reliability. Working together with our customers to better understand the environmental impact of these activities is a key pillar of our offering. \n While life cycle assessments (LCAs) introduce a product-oriented vision of the environmental impact that normally leaves the impact of maintenance activities and projects out of scope. They are far from negligible for our customers’ overall environmental footprint. Every small contribution matters. \n \nOur EconiQ™ Implementation services provide a detailed mapping of all your service and project activities’ CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing your awareness and optimizing execution to reduce or even avoid your impact, as well as compensating the remaining footprint. \nEnvironmental Sustainability\nImplementing strategies to reduce your carbon footprint to foresee a greener future, mitigating current environmental harm of your maintenance activities and fostering a sustainable tomorrow.\n\nReliability\nEnhancing energy security and securing reliability is one of our core values. Our offering includes solutions to allow our customers to boost their system reliability, addressing current and future system supply challenges. \nAffordability\nEnabling access to affordable and equitable energy through cost-effective solutions and innovative technologies, accelerating electrification, renewable integration, energy efficiency, among others. \nMeasure and evaluate your carbon footprint. Increase the awareness of your environmental footprint through a comprehensive assessment and report. \n\nUnderstand your activities and their impact\nWe are committed to minimizing your environmental impact and specifically the impact of the actions we provide to you with our services, from the definition to the execution of the works. \n\nIdentify emission hotspots through the environmental report generated\nWith the calculations made, Hitachi Energy will generate a report containing all the details of your project and the environmental impact associated with it by category, such as equipment, construction, shipping, and traveling, among others. This report will identify the emission hotspots of your services activities.\n\nDefine data-driven greener strategies\nHaving access to this data and the possibility of comparing various scenarios will allow you to define more efficient, data-driven strategies for carbon footprint improvement. \nOnce the impact of all activities has been analyzed, our experts can suggest alternatives on how to implement more sustainable maintenance activities to your power system by wisely choosing products and actions having lower environmental impact. \nMore sustainable products and materials\nWhen designing a maintenance activity, spare parts and replacement of core products have a strong impact on the overall environmental footprint. In this context, our EconiQ™ product portfolio offers you more environmentally friendly assets (SF6-free high-voltage products, transformers with less pollutant oils, etc.). Avoiding a 100g SF6-leakage is equivalent to eliminating 2 tCO2 equivalent emissions. \nPreventing unnecessary activities\nPreventing unnecessary activities is one of the pillars of an efficient and sustainable maintenance strategy. After carefully considering whether a maintenance activity of a particular asset is even necessary, the next step is to think about how you can reduce the frequency of that task or if you can perform it more efficiently. This will lead to cutting the environmental impact of existing and future maintenance activities. For example, our analysis show that eliminating a small avoidable maintenance activity can result in approximately 0.5 – 1 tCO2 equivalent emission reduction. \nExecute with a smaller footprint\nBuilding on our domain expertise in the field and our large installed base, together we will evaluate the alternatives to execute site activities tasks more efficiently. To do so, we will examine using smart shipping strategies, finding alternatives to on-site interventions, and using digital technologies as much as possible to optimize maintenance strategies. Our analysis show that for short maintenance activities, traveling is sometimes the major contributor to the carbon footprint. Every time we avoid a flight from America to Europe using augmented reality support, we are saving more than 0.5 tCO2 equivalent emissions. \nHitachi Energy offers carbon neutral and net-zero services, by adding compensation solutions to previous quantification and reduction strategies. Thanks to our key collaborations, we can now capture the CO2 emitted. \nCO2 offset\nOffset strategies create a compensation of the same amount of carbon emissions due to a specific service or activity. Carbon offsets are achieved by actions such as promoting renewable sources for energy development or tree-planting programs that balance the environmental impact of services provided. \nCO2 capture\nCapture strategies seek to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. This is achieved by capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. An effective and reliable way to make a real impact and achieve negative emissions. \nHitachi Energy offers cutting-edge sustainability services to calculate, cut and compensate for your environmental impact. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"EconiQ™ Implementation | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/substations/substation-services/econiq-implementation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Transformer Insulation and Components | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/insulation-and-components/transformer-insulation-components\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \n📢 Missed the live session?

By continuously monitoring critical parameters, MSM provides the base layer for a predictive maintenance strategy for the installation.The system is compliant with IEC 61850 and DNP 3.0 and it is provided with a web interface where all monitored data are accessible. \nApplications\n \nBased on the monitoring application, MSM is offered in 2 versions with additional options: \nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n   \nSF6 moisture \nHighly stable SF6 and gas density sensors are used to continuously monitor the integrity of the gas compartments and identify gas losses at an early stage. Advanced algorithms correct measured data for daily and seasonal variation and provide the leakage rate as well as the estimated time until counter measures are taken. Thus, gas losses which may become critical can be handled in a planned manner. In addition, the monitoring data provides a basis for SF6 and gas balancing and strategies to reduce SF6 and gas emissions by leakage repair. Starting from one gas compartment, the system can be seamlessly up-scaled to monitor several hundred gas compartments in large GIS installations.\n\nBenefits of Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) for gas applications: \nMSM gas monitoring feature is compatible with EconiQTM portfolio and other gas mixtures. \nNon-invasive hall sensors and signals from auxiliary switches are used to monitor key parameters of the circuit breaker. Measured signals include phase current during operation, trip and close coil current, and motor current. Monitored parameters are categorized in mechanical performance, wear, as well as accessories. Measured curves are stored as comtrade files on the system, allowing further analysis. \n\nAll features of MSM-I are included in this application as well.\n\nBenefits of MSM-II for circuit-breaker applications:\n \nHumidity Monitoring \nHigh levels of humidity in SF6 impact its dielectric withstand (the condensation of water on the surface of insulators will lead to significant reduction of dielectric strength and flashover) and on the formation of corrosive and toxic decomposition products.

At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way. \nThe TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.\n \nThyristor controlled series compensation principle\nThere are two main principles supporting TCSC technology. \nThe TCSC achieves both objectives by using control algorithms that work concurrently. The controls will function on the thyristor circuit (this in parallel to the main capacitor bank) such that controlled charges are added to the main capacitor, making it a variable capacitor at fundamental frequency but a \"virtual inductor\" at subsynchronous frequencies. \nThyristor controlled series compensation technology\nFrom a principal technology point of view, the TCSC resembles the conventional series capacitor. The power equipment is located on an isolated steel platform, including the thyristor valve used to control the inductor in parallel with the capacitor bank. The inductor is placed on support insulators outside the platform. Control and protection systems are located on ground potential, together with other auxiliary systems. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Thyristor controlled series compensation | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/facts/thyristor-controlled-series-compensation\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Substation and system intertie transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/power-transformers/system-intertie-transformers\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nSubstation transformers transfer the incoming high-voltage to the next lower voltage level. As an example, an incoming high-voltage of 400 kV would be transferred down to 220 kV. \nIn general, substation transformers are equipped with on-load-tap-changers (OLTC).

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings. \nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n  \nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions \nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience \nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements \nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk \nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

As a consequence, it may be necessary to inspect the internal components for signs of abnormal operation. Hitachi Energy's TXplore™ accomplishes an internal inspection examining the structure of the transformer without the need to remove the oil and send an inspector into the confined space of a power transformer. \nUsing the TXplore™ system avoids the danger of a spill when handling the oil and the risk of sending someone inside the transformer to perform an inspection. This can be accomplished during a brief outage versus conventional inspections requiring multiple days. Also, when a traditional internal inspection is complete, significant cost savings is accomplished by avoiding the oil handling and processing equipment needed to remove the oil and reprocess and fill the transformer. \nTXplore™ service can be scheduled ahead of time to take advantage of a planned outage with little or no increased downtime. It is also possible to deploy the service team to perform an inspection when unexpected issues are encountered.\n \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"TXplore™ transformer inspection robot | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/transformer-service/assess-and-secure/txplore-transformer-inspection-robot\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"Market Advisory | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/energy-portfolio-management/market-intelligence-services\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nWith the complex nature of today’s energy markets, the process of gathering, modeling and analyzing data to produce actionable intelligence is a time-consuming, resource-intensive task.

But they are often located in densely populated areas or close to sensitive ecosystems. Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards. \nApart from being oil-free, all components of dry-type transformers are in solid form; they do not have flash points or require bushings. Thus, major causes of fire and oil spillage are eliminated. The majority of insulating components used dry-type transformers can also be easily recycled. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for dry-type transformers is much lower due to the lower cost of installation and the need for a fire suppression system.\n \nHitachi Energy has been leading the development, manufacturing, and supply of dry-type transformers for more than 40 years - with path-leading technological innovation. Hitachi Energy offers a full range of dry-type transformers with primary voltages through 72.5 kV built according to all major standards, including IEC and ANSI. \n \nWith recent technological advances, Hitachi Energy has successfully designed and installed a dry-type transformer that can withstand 100 kV / 550kV Basic Impulse Level (BIL). Thus paving the way for using this sustainable and environment-friendly transformer technology at even sub-transmission level.\n \nThese transformers meet strict parameters with respect to electrical system demands and functioning in areas with extreme climatic conditions. Hitachi Energy's dry and cast transformers are virtually maintenance-free and are manufactured in accordance with industry and international standards, including ISO 9001. \nRESIBLOC® Rail dry-type traction transformer with integrated cooling system is designed to reduce CO2 emissions and total operating costs, while increasing energy efficiency \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Dry-type distribution transformers | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/distribution-transformers/dry-type-transformers\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"MicroSCADA X | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/scada/microscada-x\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nThe past three decades have seen a revolution within digital technology, leading to it becoming more popular than analog counterparts.

For example, up to 35% reduction of CO2 emissions from materials usage* is achieved (including carbon offsets from natural esters). \nUnited for Energy (U4E) – UN environment program​ \nWe have partnered with the United Nations to provide our leading expertise on distribution transformers for their U4E global initiative, which aims to reduce transformer losses globally.​ \nThe initiative’s ambitious goals estimate that 50 million tons of CO2 could be saved annually. \nRead more on U4E's goals \nCo-creating for a sustainable energy future \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"Decarbonization | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/products-and-solutions/transformers/econiq-transformers/decarbonization\" ends here.\n\nThe page with name \"High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/hvdc\" has the following content:\n\n                Choose your region and language\n             \nWhat are you looking for? \nTop Searches \nTop Pages \nMenu \nGrid-enSure™ \nResilience and stability redefined \nDigitalization \nThe power of digital made real  \nEconiQ™ Consulting \nEconiQ Consulting supports customers addressing their unique environmental performance needs \nIdentiQ™ \nMeet IdentiQ™ digital twin for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids \n EnCompass™ Agreements \nService is our commitment to the world’s largest existing installed base and the future of the energy system \nMining & Minerals \nOur technologies enable efficient, cleaner electrification in the most reliable and responsible ways \nRenewable Energy \nAccelerating a clean energy transition with a range of solutions for solar, onshore and offshore wind \nHumanising Energy \nDiscover the people and technologies behind the multiple pathways towards a carbon-neutral future \nOur eco-efficient portfolio \nOur promise towards a carbon-neutral future \n\nIntroducing EconiQ™\n\n \nHitachi Energy 2030 Plan \nAdvancing a sustainable energy future for all \nCustomer Success Stories \n Together with our customers and partners, we are co-creating global and local solutions to benefit society \n\nSee Customer Success Stories\n\n \nPerspectives \nGet in-depth insights on topics and trends in the energy sector from industry thought leaders \nThe Journey of Electricity \nJoin our electricity guru, Electron, in this animation series about the world of electricity and sustainable energy  \n\nWatch now\n\n \nDiversity 360  \nDiversity and inclusion are the core of our success  \n\nKnow more\n\n \nBuild, operate and maintain HVDC converter stations with sustainability in mind \nLearn how the HVDC technology makes it possible to increase integration of offshore wind power generation into the grid and accelerates green energy transition in Europe. \nLearn how Hitachi Energy has embraced the challenge and opportunity to realized Combined Grid Solutions, a case that could become more and more common in the years to come. \nLearn how the HVDC technology from Hitachi Energy makes it possible to increase stability and controllability of the grid and retain power transmission in the network. \nHigh-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is a key enabler for a carbon-neutral energy system. It is highly efficient for transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances, integration of renewables and interconnecting grids, opening up for new sustainable transmission solutions. \nHVDC Light®, based on VSC technology (Voltage Sourced Converter), is designed to transmit power underground and underwater, also over long distances. It offers numerous environmental benefits, including “invisible” power lines, neutral electromagnetic fields, oil-free cables and compact converter stations. \nHVDC Classic, based on LCC technology (Line Commutated Converter), is primarily used for connecting remote generation over long distances, grid interconnection and DC links in AC grid, overland or subsea, where conventional AC methods cannot be used. \nHitachi Energy has long experience in providing maintenance service and delivering upgrades for HVDC links all around the world. \nThe control system is the brain in HVDC transmission systems. One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability. \nIdentiQ™ for HVDC solution for sustainable, flexible and secure power grids. IdentiQ™ for HVDC uses digital twin technology with state-of-the-art data visualization, to provide clear operational insights in real time. \nAn HVDC back-to-back station can be used to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks. \nCables and small converter stations - HVDC has great potential for city applications. \nHVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day. \nAvoid using expensive fuel in small uneconomic plants - make an HVDC connection to a larger grid. \nDC technology provides a more secure and optimized control of a network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout. \nBeing proactive and planning an upgrade is far better than passively waiting for a breakdown. \nIn many regions of the world, liberalized energy markets have introduced the phenomenon of trading to electricity sectors and trading is enabled by coupling electricity markets with network interconnections. \nHitachi Energy's technology for the offshore wind power industry is essential in the transmission of high quality power with minimal loss. \nMany classical HVDC systems use overhead transmission lines. In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations. \nHVDC Light® can be used to deliver power both to and from offshore platforms. \nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you \n\n                        Follow us\n                     \n\nHitachi Group Website\n \nThe page with name \"High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) | Hitachi Energy\" and URL \"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en/products-and-solutions/hvdc\" ends here.\n\n"
